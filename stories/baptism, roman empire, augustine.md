The story of Augustine's /On Baptism/ is the story of the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire, so it's a fascinating read.

We have our Napoleon-type figure, a general who became emperor: Julius Caesar. He had a fallout with the Roman Senate and started a civil war by crossing the Rubicon in 49 BCE, defeated most of his Roman opposition in 48 BCE, and defeated a bunch of Egyptian opposition to Queen Cleopatra in 47 BCE, cementing a romantic alliance with the queen in the process. In 44 BCE he was assassinated.

From 44 - 36 BCE there were four civil wars; Julius Caesar's adopted son Octavian pretty much came out on the victorious side in all of them. One of his allies, Mark Antony, was now edating Cleopatra and they fought another civil war from 32 BCE - 30 BCE; Octavian won that, too, with Antony and Cleopatra committing suicide in each other's arms.

The Pax Romana ensued. The Empire was pretty manageable until around 180 CE, with good leadership until 193 CE. One big problem identified by Machiavelli is that successions stopped being adoptive and started being genetic: your kids began to inherit your titles. Five emperors ruled in 193 at different times. 

Just to summarize the transitional century 200 - 300: lots of barbarians invading, runaway inflation, cruel tyrrany, and struggles over the succession to Emperor. Nasty stuff, man. It became pretty obvious that assassinations were cripping the Roman system, so two years after Diocletian took the role in 284, he distinguished between the /augustus/ emperor and the /caesar/ emperor; he appointed a friend as caesar -- Maximian. Two years later, Maximian also declared himself /augustus/ -- neat trick, that. Diocletian at the very least did not form a civil war over it. 

Having further lands that needed to be governed, Diocletian then appointed two more /caesars/ in 293 -- his general Constantius, who was also Maximian's daughter's husband, he sent to be responsible for Gaul and Britain; and his daughter's husband Galerius, who he sent to be responsible for Syria and Egypt and the Mediterranean coast in between.

They styled it as a family endeavor. Diocletian and Maximian were brothers, Galerius and Constantius were children. The implication was dynastic succession. 

Galerius siezed an opportunity when Diocletian was sick to appoint his friends to the empty posts in an attempt at a power grab.

Severus appointed caesar of Western Rome, 1 May 305
    deputy to Constantius, who dies in summer 306
    promoted immediately to augustus of W. Rome.

Maxentius revolted at Rome; Galerius sends Severus to suppress this rebellion
Severus brings Maximian's own old army to fight Maxentius. 
    Maxentius goes to his dad and says, "hey, want to be augustus again?" and
    his dad says "yes." Severus' men said "this is f*cked up, we were just 
    serving that dude" and deserted to Maximian's side. Maximian offered to 
    spare Severus' life and give a normal life if Severus would surrender 
    peacefully; Severus accepted. Maximian imprisoned him anyway. Galerius 
    would later invade and take over, Galerius executed Severus during this
    period. 

Persecution of the Christians: starts with Diocletian, continues  until Maxentius and Constantine have together completed their revolts.

Donatists say: "hey if you were baptised and renounced it during the persecution, there's no going back, you're a church enemy!". But Augustine was fighting against this, was saying that forgiveness springs eternal and insists that you can't 'undo' a baptism in any proper sense.
