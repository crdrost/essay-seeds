Why Atheism?

Used to have this as a potential article on my desktop before it started magically reconfiguring. The ideas are now a little bit lost. :<

The question is, what's wrong with gods in particular, rather than my broad-nosed antisupernaturalism in general?

I'm adding to it here because I think one fundamental idea should be the emphasis, in theism, on stasis rather than dynamis. God is unchanging in theism.
