I will love life. I will make my life worthier to be loved.

I will be honest with myself. I will strive to see the world the way it really is.

I will act with ambition. I would rather fail gloriously than not try in the first place.

I will help others. I will share with them the gifts I've been given.

I will be humble. I will let vanity, greed, and ego fall away on my path toward enlightenment.

The point of this devotional, and the faith, can be summed up something like this:

	I do not accept that all transcendence is spiritual.
	My transcendence does not walk alongside you:
		It lives instead in every step you take.
