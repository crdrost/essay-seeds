# Atlas Reminded #

I was, at one point in my youth, heavily involved with a libertarian 
philosophical movement called Objectivism, focused around the writings of Ayn 
Rand. But since I have grown some further wisdom, the failures of my old belief 
system have become too plain for me to see: so that now, when I hear for 
example that Terry Goodkind's later *Sword of Truth* novels become an 
objectivist satire of communist ideology, I just have to think, "What a shame. 
Those first few books were so good."

Ayn Rand's philosophy is developed in her novels, which are massive heavy-
handed tomes. There are many criticisms worth making here: that all of the sex 
has a rape subtext, that she beats you over the head with the same message over 
and over, and that she seems to prefer to write an idealized version of herself 
into her own novels, with the public kowtowing to her character's clear 
supremacy. The subject of this article's namesake, /Atlas Shrugged/, for 
example, is the question "Who is John Galt?" -- and the climax is Ayn Rand 
going on a 50-page tirade about John Galt's philosophy -- which, 
coincidentally, is her own.

But let us step away from these novels and focus upon the central beliefs, and 
let us see why more wisdom is necessary.

## The Metaphysical Basics ##

I wish to begin with two quotes, one by Ayn Rand, and another by an active 
researcher who I respect. This was written on [nymag.com]
(http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/60120/): 

	Whenever Ayn Rand met someone new--an acolyte who’d traveled cross-country 
	to study at her feet, an editor hoping to publish her next novel--she would 
	open the conversation with a line that seems destined to go down as one of 
	history’s all-time classic icebreakers: “Tell me your premises.”

As for the other quote, Scott Aaronson is a quantum complexity researcher who 
wrote a blog post about [the top ten signs that a mathematical breakthrough is 
wrong](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=304). The last element on his list 
is the one that has been etched into my memory:

    10. The techniques just seem too wimpy for the problem at hand. Of all ten 
	tests, this is the slipperiest and hardest to apply--but also the decisive 
	one in many cases. As an analogy, suppose your friend in Boston blindfolded 
	you, drove you around for twenty minutes, then took the blindfold off and 
	claimed you were now in Beijing. Yes, you do see Chinese signs and pagoda 
	roofs, and no, you can’t immediately disprove him — but based on your 
	knowledge of both cars and geography, isn’t it more likely you’re just in 
	Chinatown? I know it’s trite, but this is exactly how I feel when I see 
	(for example) a paper that uses category theory to prove NL≠NP. We start in 
	Boston, we end up in Beijing, and at no point is anything resembling an 
	ocean ever crossed.

There is a mix of both of these when I read Rand's metaphysical structure. She 
will gladly tell you her premises, but those premises are too weak to justify 
the structure that they are being used to construct.

Fpr example, the Objectivist will tell you that "existence exists." This is 
something that we might recognize as a tautology -- in other words, if 
something called "existence" *didn't* exist after some fashion, we'd hardly be 
right in calling it "existence" in the first place. And I think that this is 
the point of this particular phrasing, as opposed to, say, "reality exists". 
The Objectivist wants it to sound like a trivial, defined, tautological, 
unarguable truth, a matter of mere semantics.

But that's not how they use the actual concept. They want this concept to carry 
a heavy philosophical weight -- and tautologies are not load-bearing beams. So, 
they want to use this to state that some things exist -- rather than nothing. I 
think a far better argument is that we are existent things, therefore some 
things exist. They want you to come to recognize that reality -- existence -- 
rules over your conscious experience: that fantasies cannot become your 
reality. Implicit here is the relative uselesness of fantasy, and the 
Objectivist wants to emphasize that you must engage with your real 
circumstances.

These might all be interesting conclusions: but as Aaronson's analogy goes, 
they are Beijing to our Boston. How do we get from one side of the world to the 
other in a couple short paragraphs?

To elucidate this, I will give another example. The other major Objectivist 
metaphysical premise goes by the name "A is A" -- it is an axiom of identity. 
Taken the way it's stated, this seems to be totally tautological: of course 
something is equal to itself. What could possibly follow from this useless 
aspect of the word "equal"?

Here's how the Objectivist sees this. "Well, everything has a specific nature 
-- specific properties and so on, and A = A really enshrines this by saying 
that two things are equal if they have the same properties: and that properties 
are self-consistent.  In short, everything has an identity, and those 
identities are distinct from other things with different identities. This means 
that reality has a coherent identity of its own: which means that reality 
itself is self-consistent, and that we may come to know its nature."

If you try to study how these ideas are actually coming forth, you can see that 
what's really happening is that the argument does not really ever use "A = A." 
The argument instead looks like this: "Every thing has a self-consistent 
nature, Reality is a thing, therefore reality has a self-consistent nature." 
The premises -- premises which Ayn Rand is *not* telling you -- are that 
everything has a self-consistent nature and that reality is like everything 
else in this regard. But those premises are meaty things, and are not 
tautologies like "A is A."

Indeed, these added propositions are intuitions about the world. Basically all 
of the axioms are intuitions. And this presents a real paradox for Objectivism: 
because the fundamental hope for Objectivism is to ground all human emotion, 
and all interpretation of reality, in cold, hard, objective logic. As Rand's 
*Philosophy: Who Needs It?* argues:

	Your only choice is whether you define your philosophy by a conscious, 
	rational, disciplined process of thought and scrupulously logical 
	deliberation -- or let your subconscious accumulate a junk heap of 
	unwarranted conclusions, false generalizations, undefined contradictions, 
	undigested slogans, unidentified wishes, doubts and fears, thrown together 
	by chance, but integrated by your subconscious into a kind of mongrel 
	philosophy and fused into a single, solid weight: self-doubt, like a ball 
	and chain in the place where your mind's wings should have grown. 

But as I've shown above, the logic is just for show: the basis for Objectivism 
is in fact deep metaphysical intuitions that we have about our world. We have 
this intuition that we are not sitting inside a dream -- that we are instead 
cognizant of an external world which we can know and model and understand. The 
problem is that our intuitions do not come to us by a disciplined process of 
thought, and are not part of a scrupulous logical deliberation. They are just 
things which seem true to us. Where Ayn Rand wants to avoid the junk heap, she 
does it by sweeping it under a carpet and pretending that it is not there. 

I will give one very peculiar example of this before I go on. Objectivist 
ethics was the original libertarian philosophy that I know of to make a case
for the "eye-for-an-eye" system: she classifies force as "initiated" or 
"retaliatory" and gives sanction to retaliation, while forcing the sin into 
the initiation. In *The Objectivist Ethics* she says:
    
    Men have the right to use physical force only in retaliation and only 
    against those who initiate its use. The ethical principle involved is 
    simple and clear-cut: it is the difference between murder and self-
    defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a value, wealth, by killing his 
    victim; the victim does not grow richer by killing a holdup man. The 
    principle is: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to
    physical force.

Probably the best voice on the value of intuition comes from Kant, whose 
analogy in the *Critique of Pure Reason* comes readily to my mind:

    The light dove, cleaving the air in her free flight, and feeling its 
	resistance, might imagine that its flight would be still easier in empty 
	space.  ... All thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain 
	characters, relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to 
	sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us.

In wishing to clear away Rand's "junk heap", we defeat ourselves by wishing to 
take wing in the vacuum of space: and if we truly followed Rand's advice, our 
mind's wings would have nothing to push on, to keep us flying. We must 
acknowledge these intuitions simply because we have no other choice. We must 
base our philosophies in our subjective "junk heaps" because we are subjects. 
Rand wants you to *compute* that reality is knowable, but I maintain that you 
have to *feel* it.

## The Ethics Problem ##

While Objectivists have their metaphysics totally backwards, their ethics is as 
non-orientable as a Mobius strip: follow it out far enough and it can suddenly 
reverse its direction, making your previous blessings into sins, and sins into 
blessings.

This isn't necessarily so bad. It's, I think, very typical of human moral 
systems that some values and themes expressed become contrary, and one neds to
prioritize. The famous example is a murderer who is pursuing a woman who you 
believe is innocent: he asks you where she went, and you must make a choice 
about which is more valuable: honest dealing with this person, or the life of
some woman who you've never met. 

I think Rand doesn't have this option. It gets especially problematic because 
Rand wanted ethics to be absolutely clear and united. She seems to insist, in 
*The Objectivist Ethics*, that there are no contradictory values in ethics and
that you must always act according to strict moral imperatives:
    
    "...one must earn the right to hold oneself as one’s own highest value 
    by achieving one’s own moral perfection -- which one achieves by never 
    accepting any code of irrational virtues impossible to practice and by 
    never failing to practice the virtues one knows to be rational..."

Notice that we're meant to reject virtues which are "impossible to practice." 
I think Rand's virtues may well be of this sort. Let us see several instances
of this Mobius strip, this snake biting its own behind.

The most obvious case to be made is the one of altruism, which in Objectivist 
philosophy must be distinguished from benevolence: in benevolence, you promote 
the good of others; in altruism, you sacrifice some share of your own well-
being to promote the good of others. Objectivists might have done better if 
they had used the word "sacrifice" and thus said that they were generally 
opposed to self-sacrifice. How do they get to this end-point, where they 
disagree with self-sacrifice? As  *Atlas Shrugged* says:
    
	For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed 
	that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your 
	neighbors - between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for 
	the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-
	sacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say 
	that your life belongs to you and that the good is to live it. 

In other words, the Objectivist has decided to "take her life in her own hands" 
and thus become essentially self-serving. 

I will talk more on the paradox that other people project altruism as self-
serving behaviour later, but it's instructive now to step back and say, "what,
you don't believe in cooperation? Every man for himself? Nobody sacrifices 
anything for anyone else, nobody acts with the good of others in mind?" This is
skipped by Objectivists when they come back to the tail, to reveal the snake 
biting it. You see, Objectivism believes that you will be kind to others as 
part of a communal "tit-for-tat" strategy: if you are unkind to another person, 
they will be more likely to be unkind to you.  The idea is that we benefit so
much from our shared interactions that we can be altruists due to pure greed.

In other words, if you overpay someone intentionally by $20 because you think
they need it more than you do, that is the heart and soul of evil. But if you 
do it because you think it will ease your trading relations with them later,
that they will think of you as a kind person, then that is the heart and soul
of goodness. The act of giving the $20 tip is assigned either morality based 
on the character of your intention, with superficially similar intentions 
being moral opposites. This is what I mean by a Mobius strip: You can follow
the same philosophy further and find yourself upside-down compared to where
you once were.

## Rand on Fraud ##

Now, there are many known problems with this ideology. For example, from day 
one, Objectivism has had to deal with the chiefly-libertarian problem of fraud. 
Many libertarians define the essence of wrongdoing as "initiation of force," 
and as far as I know this distinction is one of Rand's coinings -- or at least
she is a chief proponent. Yet it is hard to see how things like conspiracy and
defrauding someone, or any sort of lying or dishonesty, counts as a wrongdoing
in this sense of "initiating force." Embezzling funds which you were entrusted
with or failing to complete your side of a contract don't really amount to any 
sort of physical attack upon someone else. They are strictly speaking just a 
betrayal of trust. 

I will give a simple example. If I successfully spread a rumor that a 
company is about to release an exciting new product even when they are not, I 
can turn a profit both from the excitement of the investors buying up stock, 
and then another profit from their disappointment when the company releases an 
official statement saying that they have no such plans. We'll call this the 
crooked investor. Here is what Rand has to say about the matter in her novel
*Atlas Shrugged*:

	Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can 
	have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained 
	by fraud -- that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others 
	is an act of raising your victims to a position higher than reality, where 
	you become a pawn of their blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and 
	their evasions, while their intelligence, their rationality, their 
	perceptiveness becomes the enemies you have to dread and flee -- that you 
	do not care to live as a dependent, least of all a dependent on the 
	stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of values is the fools he 
	succeeds in fooling -- that honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice 
	for the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can 
	practice: his refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the 
	deluded consciousness of others.

This is a very peculiar response, and you may need to read it several times in 
order to fully grasp what she's saying. (I needed to, at any rate.) The core 
of the argument is that it is somehow pure selfishness which stops the crooked
investor from spreading rumors. 

I see her argument in two parts, and will respond with three objections.

### When is A not A? ###
In the first part, she asserts that a liar is somehow metaphysically 
sacrificing truth within themselves, by being more concerned with what someone else thinks than with what is true. But in Objectivism, "what someone else 
thinks" is a valid part of objective reality, and this distinction cannot hold. 

You simply aren't intrinsically trading truth for falsehood, as Rand would 
claim, if you still know the truth yourself. "She thinks I am honest when I am 
actually conning her" is a perfectly apt description of reality; it does not 
raise anyone "higher than reality." In addition, the money that our crooked
investor gets is perfectly real and indeed has value, though obtained by fraud.

You see, on the one branch of the Mobius strip, we say that it's useless to 
disengage from the brute facts of reality, which has exactly one nature which
cannot be argued. Money is money because A is A: this means that money has a 
definite nature which cannot be argued with, and it's no use to say that a $20
bill has no value. But follow the argument a little further and suddenly, the
value of the $20 bill is nothing, if you obtained it by fraud, because the
unreal is unreal. A is A, used to prove that B is not B. 

The only real way to make sense of this is to assert that money never really 
had value in the first place. But Rand's definition of "value" boils down to
one thing: the values you have are the stuff that you need to survive. The $20
bill can certainly help you survive, and can certainly outweigh the loss that
you face from angering the person you've conned. So let's not have this odd 
business of saying that it is "unreal" simply because it was obtained by fraud.
Let's not say that you're a "slave" simply because you have a "day job" which
consists in knowing how people respond to stimuli, and providing those stimuli 
for profit. 

### When authors argue against fiction ###
The second problem that I have in this first stage of the argument is that it
is already ridiculously overbroad: it takes the form, "all pretending is 
inherently immoral, and a con artist must pretend." It would seem to be very 
difficult to accept, then, any writing of fiction or any professional acting, 
or "little white lies" or even major lies made to save the lives of you or 
others. At the very least, these things should outweigh business concerns, so 
that our corrupt investor does not spread rumors.

In a moment I will dive into further arguments where she jumps out of this 
frying pan, at the cost of plunging headfirst into fire.

### How dependent can we be? ###
I said she was making two arguments, the first being this overbroad one about
metaphysical sacrifice. She uses this as a springboard into an associated 
discussion on dependence. What she is saying is, nobody should be dependent on 
anyone for anything, and the fraudster is dependent on someone's stupidity for 
their own cash. Independence is a major talking-point for Rand, but here she 
extends "dependence" as far as even depending on the expected behaviour of 
others. Because the corrupt investor *depends* on the fact that speculators
will drive the prices up and then down, the rumor-spreader is sacrificing their 
own status as an independent being!

This is not an *incoherent* response, but it's an *unacceptable* one. We work
together every day. When you drive a car, you are depending on the person 
driving in the lane beside you to be a competent driver who obeys the rules and 
conventions of the road. You depend, as a capitalist, on the farmers who 
actually grow your food to want to trade it for other things, so that your work 
on widgets can translate, at the end of the day, into food on your plate. The 
very harmony of interests which drives libertarian philosophy is a complicated 
interdependence of people -- and Rand's response to fraud is to say that fraud 
is bad because interdependence is bad. 

## Fraud and Force as Harm ##

She had modified this point in *The Objectivist Ethics* to incorporate some 
form of malice, which is an important component. Rand does not rely on the 
emotional content of malice, but instead portrays it as self-killing:
    
    "If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud, by 
    looting, robbing, cheating or enslaving the men who produce, it still 
    remains true that their survival is made possible only by their 
    victims, only by the men who choose to think and to produce the goods 
    which they, the looters, are seizing. Such looters are parasites 
    incapable of survival, who exist by destroying those who are capable, 
    those who are pursuing a course of action proper to man."

I hope you can see how the argument has shifted: it is no longer that I am 
somehow sacificing my honesty; it is that I am "biting the hand which feeds 
me", or somehow harming those who I need to do business with. This seems to do 
a little better: theft and fraud are subject to a "no harm, no foul" rule where
if they don't hurt anyone, they are not really evil. 

An "initiation of harm" (my term) becomes the extension of initiation of force 
which covers fraud. She does not use this term but prefers to just use the word
"destroying", but the initiation/retaliation distinction is still there. For
example, here is how she discusses destruction in *Atlas Shrugged*:
    
    "It is only as retaliation that force may be used and only against the man 
    who starts its use. No, I do not share his evil or sink to his concept of 
    morality: I merely grant him his choice, destruction, the only destruction 
    he had the right to choose: his own. He uses force to seize a value; I use 
    it only to destroy destruction."
    
In other words, the harming of those you rely on is viewed as implicit 
self-harm, and, in a bizarre twist, they say "your wish is granted" and try to
actively harm such people. The Objectivist moral system contorts to describe 
such people as desiring the retaliatory force and unable to revoke their 
consent. On the one hand the ideology is pragmatically much better: at least, 
we can say that acting and fiction and "white lies" are okay. But if we 
followed these underpinnings we should surely find ourselves in dire straits.

The first implication is that destruction is not a relative term, and there is
no sense that the punishment should have similar magnitude to the crime. If 
you taunt someone enough, they might try to slap you: but now you know that they 
are in the wrong, and you might shoot them! There  is a distinction between tit-
for-tat and mutual assured destruction, and it's not clear that Objectivist 
ethics can sustain such a distinction.

The second implication is that destruction does not have to be accomplished by
the person who was harmed -- indeed, in cases of murder, it cannot be. So, can 
retaliation be intercessory? Perhaps Alice is harmed by Bob, but she does not 
retaliate. Perhaps Carl finds out about Bob's initiation of harm. It sounds 
like Bob is allowed to retaliate without Alice's permission. Perhaps Carl 
should imagine them both to have a death-wish, and should shoot them both for 
this crime! 

Carl's predicament can be seen this way: suppose Carl is dating Alice, and Bob
is Alice's drug-dealer, giving her strongly addictive drugs which, as Carl 
forsees, will lead to a wasted life and/or a premature death. In some sense,
Carl is indeed harmed, even though the action is voluntary on Alice's part, but
it doesn't seem like force is being invoked here. And yet, to follow the Mobius
strip to the other side, the "high" of drugs seems to be a dishonest
replacement for the honest and rational life which Rand wants to advocate, and
Bob as a dealer is a textbook example of a parasite who is damaging his client, 
*despite* not using force or fraud to do it! One stroll down Objectivist Lane 
suggests a policy of raw nonintervention in the drug trade; the other suggests 
that we treat it like all similar offenses and ban it strictly. 

These topics come to the foreground in one example from American history, where
the U.S. government banned cigarette companies from television advertising.
Surprisingly, the biggest supporter of this ban was the tobacco lobby! The 
issue was that the advertising was gettting so extreme that it was draining
valuable profits; but if any voluntary coalition of companies refused to 
advertise, a competitor would enter the market who was not party to this 
agreement, and they would use their monopoly on advertising to succeed wildly. 
In *The Objectivist Ethics* Rand insists on "a full, pure, uncontrolled, 
unregulated laissez-faire capitalism -- with a separation of state and 
economics." Does this apply even when the entire tobacco industry asks us to 
regulate them -- indeed, to regulate all of posterity in this market -- 
to prevent ongoing harm?

This comes to the foreground in another example which occurred in several 
countries: the ban of the slave trade. Once upon a time, the U.S. government
did not control or regulate the slave trade -- the men on the merchant ships
said, "yes, these people are our property," and the government did not check
their assertions (and would have had no way to do so). The government *did*
enforce these property claims when those slaves attempted to escape, even in
the face of abuses from the slaveowners. There is tension in the system, 
then. Sometimes perhaps we need to be "saved from ourselves," even 
economically.

So which is it? Is there ever just cause to "save us from ourselves"? In
the case of saving us from our human tendency to commit fraud and to
initiate force, Rand says yes. But in the broad economics case, Rand has 
insisted that governments must stay out. Modern Objectivists, I think, would
ignore Rand's case for unregulated capitalism, in favor of regulations like 
"you may not trade slaves" and "the government can help a market if it's in
that market's financial interest." But I can't say for sure. 

So, those are my first examples of Objectivism turning upon itself. Looked at 
one way, you should promote free capitalism and libertarian politics: but 
follow  the Mobius strip far enough, and you will be on the other side, 
stating that nobody should pretend to anything or depend on anybody else, lest 
they sacrifice their independence. Pressed for further nuance, you articulate
a condition of not harming others, but this makes the question even murkier.

I will give an example which Ayn Rand does *not* fully develop, however. 
Objectivism believes that benevolence can come from a rational self-interest. 
But what if *altruism* -- self-sacrifice -- could come from a rational self-
interest? It may sound far-fetched to Objectivists, but in "the battle of 
morality" that Rand was talking about, very few of the modern contenders argue 
that "your life belongs to God" or that "it belongs to your neighbors."

On the one hand, you have figures like the current Dalai Lama, who repeatedly 
advocates for altruism: in his view, compassion and kindness are fundamental 
aspects of human nature which bring us a deep peace of mind, which better 
allows us to calmly, rationally develop ourselves. I might add this example: 
when I see my nephew and niece playing in the snow together, they are smiling 
and kind and happy: but when I see them angry and crying, it is usually because 
they are fighting over who gets to use their latest new toy. And on the other 
hand, you have Protestant Christians who argue that God is real and will bring 
you material success for your piety -- or will grant you vast rewards in a life 
after death. 

Now, notice that if either of these groups are correct, then that is an 
objective fact which is correct for everyone -- and certainly correct for 
Objectivists. It would then be in your rational self-interest to be either 
Other-serving or God-serving, such as the case may be, *even if you are taking 
your life in your own hands*. Self-serving might well mean Other-serving or 
God-serving, if those are better than pure greed at serving the self. In fact, 
it might even be justified for an Objectivist government to *force* you to be 
God-serving -- a theocracy -- if it were indeed a known truth that God rewards 
the pious! Choosing against your rational self-interest (by choosing to reject 
God) would be similar to how Rand characterized fraud: and if the Objectivist 
government protects us from fraud, it would stand to reason that the 
Objectivist theocracy might protect us from impiety. 

So the harmony of interests -- which Objectivists largely accept -- is just one 
step down the road which rejects hedonism and promotes helping other people. 
But if reality turns out to be either the way that the Dalai Lama says it is, 
or the way that some Protestant Christians say it is, then Objectivism would 
compel you to accept reality and thus accept either altruism or theocracy. We'd 
find ourselves on the other side of the Mobius strip again, and everything we 
thought was wrong would be upside-down. 

The only solution would seem to be for the Objectivist to assert that they 
*know* that inner peace is not cultivated by helping others, and to assert that 
they *know* that God does not reward the pious. These would seem to be rather 
tall orders for an Objectivist ethics, which still stumbles over the fact that 
most altruists are merely saying "make others happy," not "make yourself sad." 
In the absence of a firm knowledge about the character of reality, the 
Objectivist is left with the statement, "I am against self-sacrifice... unless 
it turns out to be good for me."

To be fair, many Objectivists are very dogmatically atheistic -- I have even 
heard some go so far as to say that they think God is a meaningless term. I 
haven't yet seen any of them stand up to a theologian's complexity, though, so 
it is safe to say that they probably don't know what they're talking about and 
view the possibility of a God as an inconvenience to their worldview. At the 
very least, I would like to ask any Objectivists reading this paragraph: do you 
also dogmatically believe that inner peace doesn't exist? It's a curious way to 
get out from the underlying problem, to say the least.

## How We Move Forward ##

If Objectivism is plagued with inadequacies, how do we move forward? What are 
the parts that are okay about Objectivism, and what are the parts which require 
tweaking?

Well, Objectivists largely have functioning intuitions -- for example, Rand 
correctly identified that fraud was bad, and that it involved dishonesty, which 
is also bad. But these need to be pulled forth as first-class knowledge. Rand's 
famous quote says that "My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a 
heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with 
productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only 
absolute." About the only thing that needs to really be dropped is this last 
pretense that we-the-Objectivists are rational while everybody else is 
irrational.

And it's probably a good thing, because reality often contradicts itself in 
subtle ways. For example, receiving a gift makes you happy, but the people with 
the most stuff aren't generally the happiest people. It is bad to deceive 
people, but sometimes it can serve a greater purpose, such as leading them into 
a surprise birthday party or bringing enemies to a common table so that they 
can negotiate a peace; or it might protect an innocent from a pursuer if you 
deceive the pursuer. Ayn Rand thought that her philosophy would bring her 
happiness, but still struggled with depression after *The Fountainhead* and 
*Atlas Shrugged*. The same fire which brings warmth and thus survival can also 
bring burns and thus death. We swim safely in streams which routinely carve up 
mountains. We often hurt the ones we love most.

I think that we should also abandon the Objectivist's favorite word of 
"philosophy" -- Philosophy is an academic field defined by a tradition of 
philosophical authors and topics, complete with heavyweights like Kant and 
Heidegger. If you aren't going to engage with that massive narrative, then what 
you've got is no philosophy.

At least in my case, I view it as more productive to view my beliefs as 
religious beliefs, and to view the essential purpose of my religion as 
reminding me of the things I already knew but took for granted. I would hope 
that people who read this and choose to distance themselves from Objectivism 
would consider this a similar sort of reminding.
