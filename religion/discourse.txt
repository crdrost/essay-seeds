I ask, "When should I say something and when should I keep my mouth shut?" 

The unphilosophical atheist responds, "Whenever something is true," or possibly, if she's a bit more nuanced, "Whenever something is true and pointing it out could lead to the betterment of the individual, or of society." She, like Hitchens and Dawkins, want to educate people about the horrid consequences of their wrong religions, after all. But that smells wrong to me, because the very class of statements where this question becomes important includes things like, "Egads, you're overweight! You need to lose a bunch of that gut, tubby!" and other curiosities of politeness. It may be entirely true that someone is overweight and, for their own health's sake, need to drop several pounds. But she still shouldn't say it; it's impolite. The mere fact that it's true and that pointing it out could lead to the individual's eventual weight loss doesn't mean that we should do it.

"Ah," says the unphilosophical Christian. "This is just a do-unto-others situation. Guess how you would react if someone told you that you were fatty-fat-fat, and if you wouldn't want that, don't do it." Except I don't happen to be fatty-fat-fat, so if it were directed at me, I would regard that comment as <em>a joke</em>. "Well, you should imagine yourself in their shoes, so to speak; it's a sympathy principle." I'm still not sure -- if I were in their shoes I'd probably want to lose the weight, and would hope that people would point it out to me more often, even if it meant weathering insults for a couple of months while I lost that weight. At some point, you'll have to start me off in alienating the very things that make me <em>me</em>, trying to keep my moral judgment intact even as you burn away my history. There's got to be something better.



The unphilosophical Objectivist doesn't like me describing him as unphilosophical, and he jumps up to enter the discussion promptly. "Politeness has nothing to do with rational self-interest; and if I limit my remarks to be polite per se, then I sacrifice my honesty and independence. But I sometimes limit my remarks because they would make you less likely to trade with me. My politeness is an offer I provide in exchange for later benefits." I don't really find that persuasive either. 

Perhaps I was wrong to ask normal, unphilosophical people. Let's ask the professionals: "When should I keep my mouth shut out of politeness?"

The cultural relativist is the first to chime in: "No, see, you're not supposed to second-guess politeness. Your culture decides on what's polite or impolite arbitrarily; and you are just stuck with it until you move to a different culture." But this, too, dissatisfies me. It seems like there are patterns and consistent goals in most cultures' standards of politeness, and it's hard to find cultures where the supposedly-arbitrary politeness standards are <em>reversed</em>: where, for example, it is categorically impolite to say <em>any</em> true thing <em>unless</em> it also upsets people. If I ask "why are polite things polite?" the cultural relativist is either offering a non-answer, or, more likely, an unsatisfying one: to say that "the culture chose these norms arbitrarily, without any implicit trans-cultural guiding ethical principles" just doesn't look right to me. It smacks of some sort of ethical nihilism that doesn't match the patterns that I see in the world.

"Aha," says the consequentialist, "the relativist is wrong! See, you make someone worse off by telling them these impolite things, and that's a bad consequence, which means that you shouldn't do it!" But this also has me at a loss. When did I speak about the consequences of my utterance? Perhaps we imagine that someone's feelings get hurt; but we might also imagine that they take the steps to lose the weight and five years later, with a much more successful romantic life and a much lower risk of heart disease, they come back to me and say, "thank you for pressuring me at that critical time in my life -- now that I have my weight under control, my life is a million times better. Thank you." Indeed, I've established that this is more or less how I think I would feel if I woke up overweight and oblivious about it tomorrow morning. Maybe it has great consequences; it is still impolite to say.

Put another way, we don't really know the consequences of the utterance, even up to a "best guess" of those consequences. In some scenarios, the consequence might make a net good; in some others, the consequence might make a net bad; the only constant that I know is that <em>in the short term</em> it probably hurts their feelings. But the consequentialist cannot justify only looking at the short-term history; consequences are consequences no matter how much later they happen. So the consequentialist is barren on this topic: there is a situation where I <em>should</em> keep my mouth shut, as far as I can tell, but the consequentialist insists that I cannot actually be correct on this judgment unless I "forsee the future / before it takes form," as Troubled Hubble put it. 

The deontologist applauds in the corner and says, "good work! Rebuking consequentialism makes you one of us! The politeness or impoliteness exists in the utterance and the act of uttering it: it was either a right or a wrong thing to say. It's the causes, not the effects, that contain the morality." 

Now, this is <em>very</em> interesting, so I press her further -- because, frankly, I'm not really sure what the <em>content</em> of her message is. "It sounds like you want to consider the utterance in a vacuum. Are you saying that there are no utterances which are polite in one context but impolite in another, such that all utterances are objectively polite or impolite? Because that sounds implausible to me." 

She says, "no, see, it's your moral duty to say things that are polite <em>in their context</em>. The utterance is not objectively polite or impolite, but it is objectively polite in situation X and impolite in situation Y."

Well, I'm still a bit baffled. "But surely the effect <em>matters</em>. I mean, the most honest reason I can think why this is wrong is, 'it's not something they want to hear, and I don't have to tell them anyway.' The former is measured by the effect that my utterance would have on this person, if I said it. So the anticipated effects of the action show us the very reason why it is impolite to say."

She smiles and says, "Oh yes! Whether a person wants to hear about an utterance is a fact about the utterance itself. So, we just clarify our maxim. It's your moral duty to avoid telling people things that they don't want to hear, unless you specifically have to tell them those things for some other reason."

I ask incredulously, "Why can't I thus dress up consequentialism as deontology? You have a duty to avoid acts that have bad consequences. Done." 

She nimbly slides around that. "Properly speaking, I suppose deontology owes its history to the rejection of consequentialism: a deontologist believes that there is at least one act which is not judged by its consequences alone. But there's nothing stopping the deontologist from <em>also</em> considering consequences sometimes. Anyway, the critical difference for me is that the consequentialist's norms are usually directed to the community as a whole -- here is how the world should be -- and for me the norms apply more on an individual level. Yes, you can hack together consequentialism from telling each person that their norms include making the world into the consequentialist's vision, but that doesn't <em>feel</em> like consequentialism."

Unable to feel the same drive that she does -- 

The virtue ethicist intervenes now. "

The Kantian pipes up now: "Of course, deontology leaves tons of leeway, and is best understood as a <em>negation</em> of consequentialism -- 'there is at least one act which should not be judged by its consequences alone.' But of <em>course</em> that's broad. You need some other sorts of imperatives -- ones that define people as ends and forbid hypocrisy -- before you get to a <em>real</em> ethical system." 

Dissatisfied with deontology as not really having any input on my question of <em>when should I keep my mouth shut</em>, and determined to keep it shut further on the subject of deontology lest I embarrass myself, I ask the
