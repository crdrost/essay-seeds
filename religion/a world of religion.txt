Religion deals with certain themes.
 - Ultimate meaning or purpose (of life or existence )
 - Creation of the universe?
 - End of the universe?
 - God?
 - "symbols which act to establish powerful, pervasive and 
    long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating
    concepts of a general order of existence and clothing 
    these concepts with such an aura of factual reality that
    the moods and motivations seem ____ realistic."
    "Culturally patterned interactions with culturally 
    postulated superhuman beings."
    "symbolic forms and acts that relate man to his ultimate
    conditions of existence."
    "religion originates in an attempt to represent and order beliefs, feelings, imaginings, and actions that arise in response to direct experience of the sacred and the spiritual. As this attempt expands in its formulation and elaboration, it becomes a process that creates meaning for itself on a sustaining basis in terms of both its originating experiences and its continuing responses."
