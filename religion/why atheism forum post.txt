I am religious, but not spiritual, which in the Christian's book would probably make me an atheist but in the atheist's book might seem strange. I don't believe in a supernatural realm which exists alongside our reality -- nothing of that sort, no energy fields, no chi, no ghosts, no afterlife, no 'homeopathic vibrations, no telepathy, and so on; I believe that those are intellectual mistakes made by both honest people and dishonest hucksters. This sort of broad condemnation also condemns the popular notions of God as the origin of succor and meaning and purpose in our everyday lives; but I do believe that such things [i]can[/i] be found. If it helps, I believe in [i]transcendence[/i], but my transcendence doesn't live in this separate world alongside our own -- it lives and breathes in every step that we take, if we grasp it and live it. But on the other hand, the questions that the Christian theologians raise, like [i]why is there something rather than nothing?[/i], strike me as valid open questions. I don't pretend to have the answers; and I think it's a little dangerous to call it 'God' when God is something different in the eyes of the masses. (But the theologians also don't pretend to have these answers really, at least not without trust in revelation.)

So now that I have told you my heresy, you have asked [i]why[/i] I believe that this supernatural realm doesn't exist alongside the common one. My reason is that we feel this realm [i]intuitively[/i]. Now, I love intuitions. I use them every day, in everything. They range from logical intuitions like [i]oh, I probably shouldn't contradict myself in the same sentence[/i], to moral intuitions like [i]I'm going to contradict myself because what I was saying earlier was flat-out wrong, and I shouldn't mislead anyone[/i]. I have intuitions about my field of study (physics) and about other fields like politics, and they guide interesting investigations. So I consider intuitions my friends, and am fascinated by the [i]paradoxes[/i] which occur when intuitions turn out to be wrong.

Sadly, the spiritual realm is one of those paradoxes, in my view. That is, it's a case, like the Two Envelopes Problem or the Monty Hall Problem, where our intuitions say something very clearly which turns out to be false. Now, why do I think that in this case it is not a reliable intuition? Well, there is a lot of evidence that it's not. To my mind, the textbook case of this is [url=http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/02/scariest-story.html]fire monsters in the closet[/url] -- or whatever malevolent entity that you, as a child, feared was waiting for you in the dark. You feel this personified menacing presence, you [i]just know[/i] that it is watching you, waiting, and we all know that they don't really exist. 

But I would say more. As a physicist, I have the growing belief that we would have found psychic forces by now in the physical world if these mediums and telepaths and spoon-benders had been anything other than misguided. I have dowsed before and it comes with that distinct 'wow that stick is moving on its own,' and yet dowsing routinely fails scientific experiments. Nobody takes the astrologers in the paper seriously anymore, and the people who actually insist on professional astrology -- drawing up star charts etc. -- freely admit that there is no physical reason for the planets to be anything other than some sort of archaic timekeeping system for some nonphysical process. 

The intuition, in short, feels like [i]wow, there's something there[/i], but we know that time and time again, when we have looked, [i]there was nothing there[/i]. (We also have an understanding of why this sort of sense might have a high false-positive rate: because it's much cheaper evolutionarily to get up and investigate that sort of hiding place than to get eaten by a predator who lurks therein.) So we have to accept that this intuition is not a good reason to actually believe that there is something there, and in fact it seems to habitually mislead us on these sorts of supernaturalist matters.

That is why I am not a theist in the conventional sense of the term. Though I sometimes play along with it -- for example, [i]praying[/i] -- I don't maintain the illusion that my prayer is a literal request to some divine personality to come down and change the principles of physics for me. I also don't rule out the God of the theologians, but I regard this God properly as a [i]question[/i] which has not yet been answered.
