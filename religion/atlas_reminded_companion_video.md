"atlas balked"? "atlas frowned"? Are we talking about something which Atlas did, or something which we have "shrugged off," or have we "shrugged" Atlas, the way "Atlas Illuminated" might mean that we are portraying Atlas, who has been set into an illuminated state by our portrayal?

Here's the video:

blackmail

perjury

It is a necessary consequence of war and litigation that you will inevitably hurt someone innocent.

Do criminals lose their rights? If the use of force against a person is a sin, why is it okay against some person who has already initiated force?

Some interesting discussion is given in this video about the use of God to justify government, trying to make the case that intrinsic rights are incompatible with justice and rejecting the rest of it as totalitarianism: just non-totalitarian government is done by a government given by the ordinance of God, who is the only sovereign.

Towards the end, the idea is given that rights are not "inherent" but "imputed". It's not that we have a right to life, but that we were commanded to not murder. The challenge he lays down is that secular systems would, if you followed them out, undermine a free society.

It reminds me a little of Durkheim, who pointed out that any predicate asserted of God can generally be asserted of society at large: it named us, it tends to watch us even when we think we're alone, it protects us and lends us strength and empathy in times of sorrow, but demands that we do our duty towards it, etc. In this case, the justification of society is being asserted of God, but Durkheim's maxim converts this into "society justifies society."

Still, I think there's something there, some meat on those bones. Here's how this idea can perhaps be justified, an argument by me, not in that video: Assume that we can't actually tell the difference between a world where we have sprung into existence with memories of a past, and a world where we actually have lived through those memories. Because time is Markov, this condition does actually hold; the past can be treated as only existing in memories in the present. This would seem to indicate that the rights you may or may not have depend on what people think of you, what people think you have done, and not necessarily on what you actually *have* done -- the latter is a ding-an-sich which is not accessible to us. But that sounds suspiciously dangerous. 

I think the objection would be that rights inhere in us based not upon our biology but upon what we will do -- and perhaps what we are disposed to do. Past action merely informs about disposition, but it's not a perfect guide. But there are other theories about punishment -- that it is corrective or punitive or a deterrent for future criminals. Still, when he argues that inalienable rights can't be alienated simply because a criminal commits a crime, I think that there's something deep in that point which my politics will have to address.
