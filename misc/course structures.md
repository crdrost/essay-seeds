# What is an ideal classroom?

The traditional structure of the classroom is so dreadful that I'm not sure why
the hell we do it that way. And *I'm* one of the few people who benefits from it
since I learn so much faster from listening than I learn from reading!

The first problem is that the lecturer is more or less reading a textbook. But
*anyone* could be presenting those topics and reading that textbook! If you
videotape this then you need to do it a maximum of *one* time, then the subject
is complete. Students can more accurately partition their own time around
reading said textbook and do it at their own convenience. Which means that of
the lecture/recitation/office-hours format, half of the "official" time, devoted
to the lecture, is in some sense being wasted. There should only be recitation,
and it can be guided by the lecturer themselves.

A lecture typically starts with no notes of any sort provided to the student, so
every student is working not on understanding, but on note-taking. Videotaped
lectures and available course notes offer such a powerful pedagogy: just give
the notes to the student and then they don't need to focus so hard on writing
things down for later reinforcement. The complaint here is that when we give
lecture notes to students they become more inclined to skip lectures -- but we
are already solving that problem when we simply cancel the lectures.

The third problem is that a lecture has momentum which means that it's hard for
the students to ask questions -- and when they *do*, they're derailing a lecture
which makes the other students irritated at them. **Having an agenda is bad.**
If you have a fixed agenda of what people are going to do then *interruptions*
to that agenda are insane. More importantly, such an agenda makes it very hard
to adapt a course once the agenda has been set; the revelation that your
students do not know any linear algebra, for example, would require changing a
tremendous amount of the course to rectify. Right now a professor can't even
detect this, much less fix it.

There is a good portion of lecture devoted to topics which should be review, and
this can be done on an as-needed basis more effectively if the classroom is a
bit louder.

Finally, lecturers often complain that their office hours are wasted because
nobody shows up. But first: this is why you have those expendable grad students,
so clearly they should have office hours. And second, the problem can be
mediated with technology, using something like IRC or some sort of Google
hangout: It may in other words be possible to ask questions of the TAs while at
the same time the "office hours" fall within some other lecture. 

# Rough format being proposed
1. Assign homework for topics which haven't been covered in lecture yet.
  - This should be worth a grade so that people participate, but I actually hate
    graded homeworks in general, so perhaps that's hypocritical and a bad idea.
  - Thijssen has an alternative approach: give people two "tracks"; if you turn
    in 80% of the homeworks then you get an easier exam, otherwise you get a
    harder one.
  - Homework might also be in a form where it can be swiftly graded. I hate this
    aspect of homework too, since it seems so much nicer to have "prove this"
    homeworks than multiple-choice or give-me-the-number homeworks, but it has
    the advantage that the following lecture can be tailored towards the
    problems which people "got wrong".
2. The day after homework is due, there is a class/lecture.
  - Start with a 10 minute summary of the topic they've learned.
  - Then a Q & A, questions can be sent by email but also asked live.
  - In the Dutch system there is a "koffiepauze" which can naturally end this
    component and begin the next part. Maybe the next part starts with a 5
    minute "remaining questions?" section, because a rest break is good for
    stimulating creativity.
  - If everyone is satisfied that they understand the topic then there are
    worked problems and details which could be important for the "hard" exam.
  - It's also pretty important that you can ask much lower-level questions, like
    a student who still really doesn't understand Calculus can maybe get help on
    that topic. Issues which are too specialized to one student can be moved to
    "office hours" explicitly.
3. There is also room for "deep question" structures, theorems etc.
  - The homeworks might build physical intuitions and prove helpful results.
  - Then, after Q & A, we work on one tough problem, combining all of our 
    helpful little results to generate something substantial.
4. "Recitation sections" taught by the TAs are now totally open-format.
  - These are your "office hours". They are no longer meant to recite anything.
    They can cover topics which are coming, topics which were weeks ago, topics
    which were supposed to be covered much earlier in a student's career: your
    grad students must understand that anything is on the table, as long as it
    is not doing the homework that is due the next lecture.
  - People will complain about the above set up, and office hours is a place to
    rectify those complaints. You can help with foundational-understanding
    blocks before the homework is being turned in.

# The First Lecture

The first lecture is an especially fun opportunity because it gives a period
where we can indeed address this "review material". The MIT course on black
holes had a wonderful first lecture where they just said, "why don't you guys
just ask all the questions you've ever had about black holes? We'll spend this
lecture trying to answer them." It gives a particular space to say "do you guys
all know vectors/calculus/linear algebra/representations of groups/whatever?"
in addition to running down the syllabus and explaining the format of the
course.
