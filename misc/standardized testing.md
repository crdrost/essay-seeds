I think it's important to be skeptical of standardized testing. I mean, it could be IQ tests or it could be the SATs and GREs and other sorts of large standardized examinations. I would criticize them foremost by pointing to the things which they cannot do. They lack at least two major aspects.

# Standardized Tests Don't Test Understanding

It just strikes me that the stuff which robots can grade does not overlap strongly with the sorts of proof which a human would provide to show that they understood something. The best way would be for the test to be designed as a game, 

# Standardized Tests Can't Predict Success

There is a simple reason why standardized tests could only weakly predict success, and it's because of feedback effects. What I mean is, if we look at any given department, we should expect to see no difference between the people with high test scores and the people with low test scores. Indeed, across the whole population such correlations should be suppressed by feedback.

A good standardized test would quickly become used by, say, departments to figure out whether a student is suitable for admission. It would be one of many different options.

But let us suppose that there exist many departments in a sort of meritocracy, competing for students. It would be reasonable to believe that, up to some noise factors, people go into the best department which they "can" get into, and if the departments exist in a near continuum, then we can rephrase this as: every department is filled with the students who are barely qualified to be there. 

Put another way, the admissions procedure can be described as a function which takes any two students and makes them comparable. We can model this as a function K(s) from the sorts of interesting variables which describe a student to the real number line, with some necessary assumptions about the result -- the real numbers act as a sort of model for an "aggregate score" which determines whether you will get in or not. What I have just said is that, in a competitive academic environment, incoming students will occupy a level set K(s) = C, up to some noise.

The trick is, if the admissions office has done their job right, the probability of success is a function of K -- someone who scored "better" should really be a student who is more likely to graduate. Thus there is a monotonic function p(K) which tells us the chance that you will succeed given that you scored a certain amount.

But, the rest of the argument is simple: Level sets of K are then also level sets of p(K(s)). 

So, within any department, feedback prevents any publicly-known criterion from predicting success.
