# On writing stories

Erick Wujcik (whose name I'll pronounce Voy-chik) writes advice to Game Masters
in *Amber: Diceless Roleplaying*. He says:

I will interrupt here to say that Wujcik is claiming that the end cannot be 
arbitrary. Any *anecdote* contains events in sequence with a beginning and an
end, but one distinguishing thing about a *story* is that in some sense it will
circle back to its origin.

# Joe Hortua on Plans

Wujcik started with a quote where Roger Zelazny seems to have inserted himself
in the story. I would also like to include a monologue that Joe Hortua inserted
into the end of a Leverage episode called "The Gold Job." Tech geek Hardison 
has just failed his first con, because his plan became too complicated. The 
normal series mastermind, Nate Ford, swoops in to save the day. After the 
episode climax ends, and some exposition, Hardison receives a letter that Nate
wrote to him in the beginning of the episode, outlining this backup plan.

> Hardison: "How. How could you have possibly known this?"
>
> Nate Ford: "I knew enough. I knew you had a complicated con in the works. And
> I knew that as long as we had those three things on the list, and that 
> Barbara Madsen was distracted from all the gold piling up in that useless 
> vault, that we had a shot at taking over the family business. You never count
> on the perfect plan. The perfect plan has too many moving parts, you gotta 
> expect the perfect plan to fail, I mean, that's what I do."
> 
> Hardison: "Then what do you count on?"
>
> Nate Ford: "I count on the simplest and ugliest plan, not plan A, no, but, 
> like, plan G for example. I *start* with plan G. Y'know, the quick simple 
> ugly plan that I know is gonna work if everything goes bad. I just pretty it
> up a little bit, add this and that--I gave you a backup plan, that's all."

I can't help but feel that this is generic creative advice as well as specific
character advice here. I can't help but think that Terry Goodkind had a novel
in *Wizard's First Rule* which was spiraling out of control, and he needed this
one character who's miles away in the final room for the final showdown, 
because the solution and final plot is in sight; His masterful plan fails, his
characters would never allow it to happen that way... so he goes back to his 
own Plan G; this character tears up the countryside with heartless death and 
destruction, in order to get to that damn room.


# On Circling Back

Wujcik first makes a narrow claim: that the End will answer questions posed in
the Beginning. He also makes a broader claim: contained in the Beginning is the
seed to the Ending, so that the Middle charts the blossoming of that seed and
its eventual yielding of fruit. 

Ira Glass also suggests that you're always raising questions and answering them
as you go; but he doesn't really get into this mechanic that Wujcik mentions.
Of course, the random item that the character pocketed in chapter one will be 
an important piece in some puzzle, or perhaps it will complicate some already 
complicated situation. 

The "why?" question complicates this. Why insert random little things, only for
them to become important later? It feels just so cliche and tacky! Of *course*
he had the Mojo all along--insert eyeroll here. Of *course* the solution is the
otherwise useless character who's been dragged along for half the book without
explanation. Why would you be so predictable?

I think it comes from *retelling*, and I think there's a right and wrong way to
do it. If you look at *Wizard's First Rule*, there are some very random moments
which simply drive plot forward. "I'm going to befriend a dragon, because I 
need a ride" or "Oh, and Kahlan is going to discover a violent new power just
in time to save herself from the second evilest man in existence." (Even the 
"magic of friendship" aspects of these stories don't seem to leave a lasting 
mark on Richard. The Mord-sith appearance at least, though it started random, 
and though Goodkind gave himself a *huge* out by saying, "oh, he just sealed
his mind away, it's sophisticated magic", still somehow deeply affected Richard 
and his knowledge about love.)

There were other aspects which didn't really have their fair share in the 
conclusion -- Richard spent *forever* with the Mud People and yet he didn't 
kill Darken Rahl with a poisoned arrow or spirits from the spirit house; he 
just used a gift from one of them to befriend the aforementioned dragon. BUT,
the most key part of the early novel -- Richard's egalitarian love for Kahlan, 
unmoved by fear of her station or power, plays such a nuanced and crucial role 
in the events at the climax of the novel, that it's probably *the* single 
reason why the readers become such devoted fans.

We return to the beginning and reread in order to see these seeds blossom in 
more depth, to relive with a new appreciation how this sappy romantic crap in
the first chapters led to a simple decision solving a sophisticated problem.

It probably helps if you subvert the trope a bit. Whenever you invoke this plot
mechanism, you should ask how else it might be done. 






The first fact has to be: it shouldn't feel so
*forced*. In this sense I think it's good to have objects which you *forgot* to
take, and being forced to come up with alternative solutions. This way, when 
you have the genuine article, you just got lucky -- that stops us 


 question to answer, 

You're always raising questions and you'd better answer at least the most pressing questions that begin the 
journey. You can't just meander pointlessly; people will get bored. You have to
come back to questions that started the quest and events which readers overlooked.
