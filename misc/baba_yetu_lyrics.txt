Voice:
we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a-behind
it's safe to dance and if they don't dance
well they're no friends, no friends of a-mine no

Chorus:
we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a behind
it's safe to dance and if they don't dance
well they're no friends, no friends of a-mine no

Verse:
we can go, we can go where we want to.
to places they, places they never fi-ind
like we come from out of this world!
leaving the real one behind
going, going wherever we want to
night is young and so am I
dressing neat, from hats to feet
surprise them with a victry cry~!

we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a behind
it's safe to dance and if they don't dance
well they're no friends, no friends of a-mine no
we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a behind
it's safe and if they don't dance
well they're no friends, no friends of a-mine no

OUT OF CONTROL NOW
FROM POLE INTO POLE YEAH
TAKING THE CHANCE, OH
WE CAN, OH YES IT'S SAFE TO DANCE

we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a behind
it's safe to dance and if they don't dance
well they're no friends, no friends of a-mine no
we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a behind
it's safe to dance and if they don't dance
well they're no friends, no friends of a-mine no

We can act, we can act if we want to
and if we don't then nobody will
And you can act removed and rude!
And I'll be your imbecile
Until we all can get along,
we've got all of your life and mine for it
Abusing it, not losing it
Everything will work out right!

we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a behind
we can dance, can dance if we want to
we can leave, leave your friends a behind
