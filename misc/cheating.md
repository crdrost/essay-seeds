Why do we sometimes cheat in the games that we play? Why might we sometimes not cheat?

Connections to Morrowind: not cheating per se, but I was able to be very successful in Morrowind; exploitative even. I would teleport to different places to complete quests quickly; at its peak my characters would have all-100 stats and would run through the game, climbing cliffs in acrobatic maneuvers. Sometime soon after that, the quests would begin to run out, and I would just get **bored**. 

I'm convinced that the Song of Wind plays into this quite simply. What matters is change, progress, and not the end goal. When you lose the ability to grow, you get restless and uncomfortable.

So we might sometimes choose not to cheat, simply because we want to see the messages that we get from the game as we grow stronger. It is a point of curiosity but also a point of personal reward. 

On the other hand, when I played Planescape: Torment, I would routinely cheat, and I think the reason why is that I knew that the game engine was suppressing certain options when your stats weren't good enough. If you don't have enough intelligence, for example, you might not have the option to inquire about a certain topic in a conversation, and you might not be able to "go back later".

So I would cheat in order to have more options open to myself.

# Superpowers as Cheats

I've also thought a bit about what sorts of superpowers I would like to have, and which ones I wouldn't. Typical superpowers explored by graphic novels include:
    
* Indominable strength
* Resilience (immortality, invulnerability)
* Athletics (super speed, climing, ...)
* Psychokinesis (telekinesis)
* Telepathy
* Rapid healing
* Invisibility
* Flight
* Teleportation

These can be regarded as "cheats" applied to the real world. While I wouldn't necessarily dislike any of those powers listed above, I feel like they're not as useful as they could be. Some of them, like flight or telepathy (as Stephen Gould's novel *Jumper* explores), are insufficiently discreet. It's also hard to see what exactly one uses some of these powers like athletics and invisibility for, if not spying, stealing, and police work. The ones that *are* useful every day -- healing and telekinesis -- are more passive and less useful.

Some less-explored superpowers are the "cheats" that I would be more interested in applying:

* Conjuration (object creation and destruction)
* Shapeshifting
* Emotion control
* Omnilingualism

The one that I would find the single most day-to-day use from is probably conjuration, which for me is inspired chiefly by the Amber roleplaying game. In Amber, given a short time, you can construct an arbitrarily complicated object or creature with magical powers. The fast conjurations tend to fade away fast as well; but slower conjurations can be performed for extra permanence. A high-quality self-healing laptop computer could be conjured to stay for an arbitrary time if about two hours were spent creating it, in the Amber rules -- and it would be able to 'mold Shadow stuff', meaning that its battery might never need charging and its processor might never need special cooling, reducing the form factor considerably. People in the Amber books are shown summoning delicious foods into existence with only brief effort; your foods could in principle be things like 'negative-calorie pizza,' if you like. (Cheers, Chrononauts.)

It is a dream for a life of unbounded artistry; that is why I would want to cheat in this way. Self-repairing bicycles would be one of the most convenient things one could own.

Shapeshifting is in some senses a nice generalization of flight, though it requires some sort of dualistic interpretation of the world to believe that a hawk's brain cavity can contain a human mental process. It's ubiquitous across world myths, and it's, I think, deep and exploratory. If you could change in a more mundane set of ways, the possibilities become far more interesting. Simple things come first, like changing one's race or sex. But you might also change your biological age, give yourself perfect pitch, or even increase your mental capacity. A variance exists in the Amber books, where shapeshifting automatically guarantees a healing factor -- cuts can be healed as rapidly as the shapeshifting allows.

I think that shapeshifting could ultimately be some sort or another of folly: for I still am not sure how we deal with the problems of controlling our own stimulation pathways. Still, I love the idea, which might well be realized in the world to come, that the body might reflect the imaginations of the mind directly.

I have seen emotional control only really explored in Asimov's *Foundation* books, where a malicious entity known as the Mule conquers an entire empire through an ability to adjust emotions. I must confess that I'm not totally sold on the use of this, and I don't know what the second-order implications are. Nonetheless, I enjoy making people laugh, and I would like even more the ability to go into these messed-up peace-is-hopeless regions and bring friendship to bitter enemies. On the other hand, I would really like this sort of control to show *nuance*: one only needs to look as far as Terry Goodkind's *Sword of Truth* novels to see an awful dream of a character, Kahlan, who can make men fall totally and utterly in love with her, effectively destroying their existing personalities. While she uses it effectively for self-defense and for political manipulations, it is not something that I can see as immediately relevant to my life today. 

One of the few omnilingual characters in the comics is Cypher, from X-Men's teenage "New Mutants" team. His ability is held to go beyond simply the spoken word, and he can immediately pick up on body languages, programming languages, and the like. In part this is a very personal desire: I am fascinated with languages and I have noticed that I have real difficulty learning new ones. But without this idea of "I can articulate my ideas directly in source code," which would help immensely with programming, it is not very practically useful for me: except that it could give me a good job as a translator or diplomat or so. 

I love the idea that truth speaks all languages; this superpower would allow me to realize it. I like to think that the hardest part of being persuasive and truly *communicating* with another is that we all have different experiences, which mediates an "inner language". The words that I use don't always mean the same thing to me that they do to you. I would thus love, even solely in English dialogue, the ability to know what the heck other people are trying to articulate, and how to best respond with them. It would be a qualitatively different feeling of the world, one worth using a cheat code to experience. \
