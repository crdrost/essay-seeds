# Butter frosting
    250 grams butter (2 sticks, in US terms)
    250 gr sugar     (1.5 cups, in US terms)
        (use brown sugar = basterdsuiker for more flavor)
    2 large eggs
    3 tsp vanilla

Put the butter for 5-10 seconds in a microwave so that it becomes soft but does not melt. With a fork, mix in the sugar, then both eggs and the vanilla, until it takes on a frosting-like consistency.

# Cookie Dough
    1.5 cups white flour 
    1 teaspoon salt
    1 teaspoon baking soda

Mix the above into your butter frosting to get a basic cookie dough. Then add either of these combinations:

## Oatmeal-Raisin 
    1 portion cookie dough
    1.5 cups of raisins
    3 cups rolled oats (=havermout, in the cereal aisle at Albert Heijn)
    1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Chocolate-Chip 
    1 portion cookie dough
    1 cup flour
    ~350 grams of chocolate, cut into chunks
    1 cup nuts

# How to bake

With two table spoons, pick out a consistent chunk of the cookie dough and shape it lightly before dropping them into rows on an ungreased baking sheet. 

Bake in a preheated 175 C oven for 10-15 minutes, then move to a wire 
rack to cool.
