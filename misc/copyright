Copyright is the revolutionary idea that you can be given something without getting it, as when you buy something without owning it afterwards. 

It was, of course, not originally phrased this way, and it was not phrased for this purpose: it was instead designed to guarantee that when a rival publisher bought a copy of your book, they could not reprint their own editions of it. But the method is the same: we invoke the higher idea of an "information content" of the book, and insist that though they have been sold that information content, they do not own it; they may not use it. 

Put in such stark contrast, you immediately realize that it is not limited to "intellectual property" as such. I encourage you to imagine what would happen if we had a mythical device -- a Cloner -- which could cheaply duplicate inert physical objects. On a rainy day when your friend needs an umbrella to walk home, you might think to clone your umbrella, and give them the cloned copy. The youth might establish their own underground communities full of the latest electronic gadgets, cloning them amongst themselves. Imagine the implications.

"We are not selling you the umbrella," says the corporation. "We are selling you certain rights, to use this umbrella in certain ways. In particular, we specifically withold your right to use any sort of Cloner on the umbrella, or to make any copy of the umbrella by any means at all." This sort of legalese is no joke: every modern piece of software ships with it. You've accepted this contract dozens of times at least. And every iPhone would ship with it too, if Cloners really existed.

Information is merely the most obvious target. We are natural copiers of ideas; our intellectual life thrives on it. "The Internet detects censorship as network damage, and routes around it." So do we.
