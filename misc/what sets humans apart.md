# Things which set us apart

 *  We can form complex vocal patterns
 *  We walk upright (bipedalism)
 *  We don't tiptoe everywhere (plantigrade gait)
 *  We have large brains
      * Birthing is quite difficult for us; our hips are too small.
 *  We bleed when we menstruate
      * Some animals bleed when they're in heat -- that's different.
 *  We're essentially naked
 *  Our intuitions have come detached from their immediate objects of experience.
      * "We build computers and write on them about what sets us apart."

# Things I'm less sure about

 *  Recreation
     *  We sing and have sex recreationally, among other things.
     *  Other animals play, sure, but these seem particularly peculiar.
 *  Our hearts are on the left
     *  I'm not quite sure how unique this is. There are even humans whose hearts are on the right.

Some discussion on why some of these things may be is offered by:

There is also as I recall from a television documentary on Africa, some 
discussion about the exact place where we evolved: Ethiopian highlands during
a time of great climate change, or so. I have to look that up.
