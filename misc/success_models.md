The organization of these ideas is based on a little black book by Krogerus and Tschappeler. Whether this reading will do anything other than boosting my Nederlands is valid and debatable.

# Eisenhower Matrix

The idea was originated by Stephen Covey who credited his inspiration with Dwight D. Eisenhower, suggesting that we categorize needed actions along two criteria:
    
    1. Importance -- the long-term value of a project.
    2. Urgency -- the short-term need for the project.

In some sense you are graphing rewards over time, but there is also an aspect to urgency where the payoff is less if you start later. So we're really asking 'can you be patient with this and do it later for the same reward?' 

Four extrema show up:

    urgent, important: deadlines to submit taxes.
    patient, important: exercise, planning, most work.
    urgent, unimportant: emails/interuptions, handling calls
    patient, unimportant: listening to a podcast.

Eisenhower himself insisted:

    "What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important."

I've worked out the conditional probabilities here, and this amounts to claiming that the UI category is much smaller than both the PI category and the UU category. (I will add that the PU category is infinite in size.)

The suggestion is that you categorize your time with the 
following algorithm:

    UI, then PI, then UU, then PU.

In other words, importance should dominate urgency. The smallish set of urgent-important tasks should be handled right away, of course, but then you should also get the patient-important tasks done, and leave the urgent-unimportant tasks for later.

So the Eisenhower doctrine is basically saying "don't pay attention to urgency, it's seldom important" in general.

# SWOT analysis

When you come to a new project you might find it useful to say what the end result of the project is, and how much time it might take roughly. Then, analyze the factors which play into it, both positive and negative, both internal and external.

Internal factors can usually be mentally categorized as strengths or weaknesses of your particular situation; external factors can usually be mentally categorized as opportunities and threats in that same situation, hence SWOT. 

I can't find any information on how these categories are actually used. The claim seems to be that just writing it out gives you a clearer idea of what the hell you're doing. 

# BCG theory / Growth-share matrix

BCG = Boston Consulting Group

This idea just asks you to again rank different options along two axes. In this case, the two axes are 'growth' and 'share'. A project is 'growing' if it consumes a lot of resources, especially if you have to 'keep up' with some external standard. A project has 'share' if it dominates the industry and makes you a lot of money.

Again, the chief use seems to be in labeling the four quadrants:

    growing /profitable - 'stars'
    stagnant/profitable - 'cash cows'
    growing /unprofitable - 'question marks'
    stagnant/unprofitable - 'dogs'

The goal is to say that you want cash cows. Stars are good, try to turn them into cash cows. Question marks cost you resources and you have to ask whether they're worth the risk that you're taking on. Dogs might 'break even' and might therefore be worth keeping around, but they compensate for whatever resources they give your company by making it less agile. 

Industries tend to mature and stagnate in any case, so that you should expect that stars become cash cows and questioon marks become dogs. Most opportunities start out as question marks, and good opportunities then turn into stars. So the idea is that a diversified firm uses cash cows to fund new question marks which either become dogs or stars; you cut loose the dogs and keep the stars around so that you can rake together more cash cows.

# Project portfolios

Again, we have graphs. This book loves graphs. The idea is that if you're a compulsive multitasker, you classify your projects across personal costs (high/low) and time costs (high/low). This is presented in the book and sounds to me pretty irrelevant. 

The book then suggests that these are only two examples, and you might also ask 'how much does this help me achieve higher goals?' and 'how much will I learn from this project?' Unsurprisingly, you avoid the projects which won't teach you anything and won't help you achieve higher goals. Something which won't teach you anything but which is necessary for your higher goals, you should hire someone else to do. If you can learn something but there is no reason -- well, consider it. But focus on the ones that really will further your major life goals first.

# SMART/PURE/CLEAR

The idea here is to instead give a threefold decomposition based on suggestive acronyms. Eugh.

SMART goals are smart because they are specific, come with measurable success, can be achieved, are results-oriented, and come within a definite timeframe.

PURE goals are pure because they can be positively stated, understood, are relevant to your situation, and are ethical.

CLEAR goals are clear because they are challenging, legal, environmentally sound, agreed to or appropriate, and are recorded. 

This discussion was given to me by a page which had an exit-page blocker. Eugh eugh. No I don't want to see your pathetic advertisement buddies. Ever.

It is claimed in the book that the SMART/PURE/CLEAR system is a 'John Whitmore model', but apparently Sir John Whitmore instead invented the GROW model for athletic training, and has (I think?) nothing to do with this system.

Seriously. Why the hell are these ideas such CRAP?
