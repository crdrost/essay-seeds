Interesting demonstrations of evolution:

- Great ape genome
    Miller points out that we can locate the exact great ape chromosome which
    appears to have fused into one chromosome in humans.

- Visible Light
    The colors which we can see only exist in a narrow part of a broader 
    biochemical window. I believe Feynman points out that snakes can see
    in infrared and bees can see in the ultraviolet. It can't go too far,
    though, because at microwave frequencies the photons have less energy
    than the thermal background and at gamma-ray frequencies the absorption
    could potentially destroy the cell anyways.
    
    My solid-state physics professor at Cornell pointed out that our narrow
    window in which most species have visible range seems to exactly fall 
    inside a dip in the absorption spectrum of water, indicating that a 
    chief design goal of the human eye was to see underwater. But our 
    present eyes aren't particularly great at seeing underwater, and a Thai
    tribe actually has developed a pupil-control trick to constrict your 
    pupils and increase your depth-of-field underwater to overcome the 
    various distortions. 
    
    So, synthetically, it appears that our eyes at one point in history were
    designed to see underwater, but no longer are optimized to do so. It 
    strongly suggests that the machinery of our vision was developed underwater
    and has more recently been redesigned.

- Chirality. 
    Feynman points out that sugars are chiral -- they come in a left-handed 
    and right-handed version -- but that nature only seems to produce one of
    these versions, with a chiral building apparatus. The surprising thing is
    that all of the organisms have the same chirality, even though there seems
    to be no salient left/right difference in the relevant laws of physics 
    which govern their function. Sugars from sugar beets can be eaten by 
    bacteria, while opposite-handed sugars cannot.
