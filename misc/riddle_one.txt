My first riddle-design:

I make your music and I speak with your voice, I clear the path for you to greatness. But if you depend on me, you will never find what you're missing. Though others might shake me, I carry on with your burdens. What am I?

You're my hands. The first sentence is literal, the second is figurative and the third sentence is wordplay.
