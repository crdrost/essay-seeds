choose two primes: 
	3389, 3271

Their product is your clock size:
clock size: 11085419

compute the totient:
	3388 * 3270 = 11078760

Choose a prime, make sure it doesn't divide the totient.
	523, 11078760 % 523 = 51.

Compute the inverse exponent:
	868507*523 + -41*11078760 = 1
	d = 868507

public key: (523, 11085419)
private key: (868507, 11085419)

encryption: message is 1234:
pow(1234, 523, 11085419) = 2389092

decryption:
pow(2389092, 868507, 11085419) = 1234
