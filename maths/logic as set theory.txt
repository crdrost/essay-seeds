Always explain the contrapositive rule and logical deduction with reference to cheating. It always makes more sense to the human brain:

Here is one way to phrase an if-then:

    You have to eat your vegetables before you can have ice cream.

This is the same as saying:

    Anyone who eats ice cream, ate their vegetables. 
    {ate ice cream} subset of {ate vegetables}.
    {ate ice cream} implies {ate vegetables}
    If you eat ice cream, then you ate your vegetables.

It is not the same as saying:

    If you ate your vegetables, then you ate ice cream

...because maybe someone just doesn't like ice cream. The rule says nothing about what happens if you don't eat ice cream.
