The Dual-Slit Experiment: how quantum mechanics looks from the inside out.
By Chris Drost

# Introduction: on misunderstandings #

I've noticed a lot of misunderstanding on the subject of quantum mechanics in 
the popular press, and most of it is down to Griffiths' Law of Quantum 
Mechanics:

	The purpose of this book is to teach you how to *do* quantum mechanics.
	Apart from some essential background in Chapter 1, the deeper quasi-
	philosophical questions are saved for the end. I do not believe one can
	intelligently discuss what quantum mechanics *means* until one has a 
	firm sense of what quantum mechanics *does*.
	D.J. Griffiths, /Introduction to Quantum Mechanics/.

Feynman had something similar scribbled on the chalkboard in his office: "What I
cannot create, I do not understand." The purpose of this essay is to show you a 
full derivation, including density matrices, decoherence, and "tracing out" 
supersystems, of the dual-slit experiment. In doing so, we will be establishing 
what the dual-slit experiment /means/ and addressing some common issues with its
understanding. 

I have tried to proceed from the beginning through the end without 

For example, I had a long email exchange with a military contractor named Tom
Campbell after he said the following in a Youtube-published lecture:

	"So then [the physicists] said 'let's not look, but let's leave the 
	equipment, maybe it's the equipment that's doing it,' so you leave the 
	sensors where they are, but you just turn off the power to what's 
	recording the data, so now the sensors are still in place but they're 
	not recording anything. What do you think happens? It goes through both
	slits, you get a wave pattern on the other side."
	T. Campbell,  [1][http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sB4j6L6Rzw]

This is totally wrong. If the sensors exist but don't record anything, 
decoherence probably still happens, because entanglement still happens. In 
other words, there *is* a "measurement problem," but this isn't it. I hope to
give you a better appreciation of quantum mechanics by showing you what is 
really happening in this famous puzzle. 

You will probably need some calculus and some understanding of linear algebra,
and certainly some understanding of complex numbers. I wish that I could make 
those requirements a little less strict, because unfortunately, none of those
topics is the subject of a typical high school mathematics education. But: just 
try and see how far you get. I promise I'll start slow.

# The Hilbert Space #

In quantum mechanics, the physical state of a system is usually denoted by a 
Greek letter Ψ. Ψ is an object which contains all the physics of the system, 
and it lives in a nice little mathematical world called "Hilbert space." To 
show that Ψ lives in this world, we write it in the Dirac notation with a "ket
vector":

	|Ψ>

For every "ket" |a> there is a "bra" <a|. If you have had some basic vector
algebra, then <a| represents the "complex conjugate transpose" of |a>, but this
is not terribly important. The reason for the weird names is that this is 
called the "bra-ket" notation, which sounds like "bracket" -- har har. Together
they define an inner product space:

	"a times b": <a|b> = ∫ dx a*(x) b(x).

We won't use this formula explicitly, but it is important to have some idea of
what a "dot product" looks like: you sum up the products of the entries in a* 
and b. Also interesting but not very important for us, is that our state |Ψ> 
changes over time according to the Schrödinger equation:

	i ħ |∂Ψ/∂t> = Ĥ |Ψ>

This is your first exposure to an "operator", in this case the "Hamiltonian 
operator" Ĥ, which is associated with the total energy of the system. An 
"operator" is anything which takes in a ket vector and produces another
ket vector as its output. We require operators to be /linear/, which means 
that they distribute over a sum:

	Ô [ a |u> + b |v> ] = a Ô |u> + b Ô |v>.

By the way, the above Schrödinger equation more or less just states the
Planck-Einstein law that "E = h f." A full derivation would confuse other
readers here, but you can find more information in any standard quantum
mechanics book.

Okay. We have already quietly covered a lot. Kets can be added or subtracted,
like:

	|Φ> = a |u> + b |v>
	<Φ| = a* <u| + b* <v|

And linear operators, which we write with a little "hat", distribute over these
sums. One special linear operator, the Hamiltonian Ĥ, is associated with the 
energy of the system, and it tells you how the system changes. If you are
new to these notions, it might be a good time to rest and reread this paragraph
until you're sure you understand these basic lessons.

Okay, we have bras and kets. Our Hilbert space also has a "basis": a set of 
"unit vectors" which you can use to express any other ket. For example, our
"physical state" vector |Ψ> can be written with complex numbers {cᵢ} as:

	|Ψ> = c₀ |0> + c₁ |1> + c₂ |2> + ...
	|Ψ> = Σᵢ cᵢ |i>. 
	<Ψ| = Σᵢ cᵢ* <i|

Here, the symbol Σᵢ means "sum over all possible i."

We make one restriction about the basis: it must be *orthogonal*:

	<u|v> = 1 if u = v, or 0 if they aren't. 

So for example <0|1> = 0, <0|0> = 1, <1|0> = 0, and <1|1> = 1. This means that
if you have some function fᵤᵥ of two indices, then:

	Σᵤ fᵤᵥ <u|v> = fᵥᵥ

Why? Because you are summing terms of 0 whenever u is not exactly the same as 
v, and when you sum over all u, you surely hit the case where it *is* v.

We now make one more restriction on the elements in Hilbert space: for every
real observable, we assign an operator Â. Then the *average value* of the
observable in any physical state |Φ> is given by:

	<A> = <Φ| Â |Φ>

Remember, Â will take in a ket |Φ> and produce some other ket |Φ'>, so that 
we fundamentally are saying <A> = <Φ|Φ'>. As a consequence, of this, all 
physical states in quantum mechanics are *normalized*:

	The average value of 1 is: <1> = <Φ| 1 |Φ> = <Φ|Φ>
	Thus <Φ|Φ> = 1.

This is enough for almost the complete structure of quantum mechanics. Your 
kets move around in Hilbert space according to the Schrödinger equation, and 
the average value of any observable quantity, for any state, is an inner
product containing that observable's linear operator.

An example before we go on. Suppose we have a two-level Hilbert space,
{|0>, |1>}. This system is often called a "qubit", because like a classical
bit, it can be either in the state 0 or in the state 1. Quantum mechanics
allows something slightly more complicated, though:

	|Ψ> = c₀ |0> + c₁ |1>.

We design an observable which will tell us if the system is in state |1>. It 
can be written as:

	Â = |1><1|

Why? Because if you are in a pure state 0, you would get 

	<0|Â|0> = <0|1> <1|0> = 0
	<1|Â|1> = <1|1> <1|1> = 1

The average value of <A> in |Ψ> is:

	<A> = <Ψ|Â|Ψ> =[ c₀* <0| + c₁* <1| ] |1><1| [ c₀ |0> + c₁ |1> ]
	<A> = [ c₀* <0| + c₁* <1| ] c₁ |1>
	<A> = c₁* c₁ = |c₁|²

Conclusion: |c₁|² is a sort of "probability" to be in state 1, while |c₀|² 
is a probability to be in state 0. Yes, quantum mechanics is essentially
probabilistic, and can only describe averages. But it describes averages
really well, and averages can be scientifically tested.

# Inside the Matrix #

We can use the basis vectors for our Hilbert space to change any operator Â 
into a matrix Aᵤᵢ, by describing the *end result* of Â |i> as a linear 
combination of the basis vectors:

	Â |v> = Σᵢ Aᵢᵥ |i>.

This means that the average value of A is:

	<A> = <Ψ|Â|Ψ> = [ Σᵤ cᵤ* <u| ] Â [ Σᵥ cᵥ |v> ]. 
	<A> = Σᵢᵤᵥ cᵤ* cᵥ Aᵢᵥ <u|i>
	<A> = Σᵤᵥ cᵤ* cᵥ Aᵤᵥ

We want this value to always be equal to its complex conjugate <A>*, so that 
we know that we have a real number. This puts a restricton on Aᵤᵥ:

	<A>* = Σᵤᵥ cᵤ cᵥ* Aᵤᵥ*
	Swap uv → vu:
	<A>* = Σᵥᵤ cᵥ cᵤ* Aᵥᵤ*
	<A>* = Σᵤᵥ cᵤ* cᵥ Aᵥᵤ*

For this <A> = <A>* to hold for an arbitrary state {cᵢ}, we must have:

	Aᵤᵥ = Aᵥᵤ*

We call this the "Hermitian property": any real observable has to have a matrix
which is its own conjugate transpose. Not all operators must be Hermitian, but
Hermitian operators represent observable numbers.

We now return to <A> = Σᵤᵥ cᵤ* cᵥ Aᵤᵥ, because there is a nice way to write this:

	cᵥ = <v|Ψ>
	Σᵤ cᵤ* Aᵤᵥ = <Ψ|Â|v>

Thus:
	
	<A> = Σᵥ <v|  |Ψ><Ψ| Â  |v>

We define Σᵢ <i| Ô |i> = Tr Ô, pronounced "the trace of O." If you like, the
trace can be written in the matrix form like so:

	Tr Ô = Σᵢ <i| Σᵤ Oᵤᵢ |u>
	Tr Ô = Σᵢ Oᵢᵢ.

In other words, it is the sum of the diagonal entries on the matrix. It follows
that, for Hermitian matrices, all of those diagonal entries are real numbers, 
and the trace is therefore also a real number. 

We define |Ψ><Ψ| = ρ, and we call it the "density matrix". More on this in a 
moment.

With these definitions, we come at an alternate description of quantum 
mechanics:

	i ħ ∂ρ/∂t = Ĥ ρ − ρ Ĥ = [Ĥ, ρ]
	<A> = Tr ρ Â

# Properties of trace #
The first property of trace is that it is linear:

	Tr (Ô + Â) = Σᵢ (Oᵢᵢ + Aᵢᵢ) = Σᵢ Oᵢᵢ + Σᵢ Aᵢᵢ 
	Tr (Ô + Â) = Tr Ô + Tr Â

We can also say in general that there is a commutative property. Since the 
matrix multiplication works out as follows:

	Â Ô |i> = Σᵤᵥ Aᵤᵥ Oᵥᵢ |u>

The trace Σᵢ <i| Â Ô |i> works out as:

	Tr Â Ô = Σᵢᵤᵥ <i|v> Aᵤᵥ Oᵥᵢ
	Tr Â Ô = Σᵤᵥ Aᵤᵥ Oᵥᵤ 

Interchanging u and v gives:
	
	Tr Â Ô = Σᵤᵥ Oᵤᵥ Aᵥᵤ = Tr Ô Â

This is called a "commutative property," and does not depend on the operator 
being Hermitian. Operators do not in general commute with each other, but if 
two of them are in a trace, they can commute. This property is not totally 
complete when we get to three operators, but it is /cyclic/: for example:

	Tr ĜĤÎ = Tr ÎĜĤ = Tr ĤÎĜ

We use this to prove the most important fact about trace. We said that there was
an orthogonal basis for the Hilbert space, {|i>}, but there is no guarantee that
there isn't another orthogonal basis {|φᵢ>}. For example, the alternate basis:

	|+> = [ |0> + |1> ] / √2
	|−> = [ |0> − |1> ] / √2

...still has the property that <+|+> = <−|−> = 1, <−|+> = <+|−> = 0.

One simple way to choose these orthogonal basis vectors {|φᵢ>} as your basis 
{|i>} requires the following non-Hermitian coordinate-change matrix:

	Ĉ = Σᵢ |i><φᵢ|
	Ĉ⁻¹ = Σᵢ |φᵢ><i|
	Ĉ Ĉ⁻¹ = Ĉ⁻¹ Ĉ = 1

Any other operator Â would be represented in this basis as:

	Â' = Ĉ Â Ĉ⁻¹

Which can be read as "change back to the original basis, apply Â, and then go
again to the altered basis.

But, crucially, our cyclic rule says:

	Tr Â' = Tr Ĉ Â Ĉ⁻¹ = Tr Â Ĉ⁻¹ Ĉ = Tr Â.

Thus the trace is totally basis-independent.

In particular, consider the eigenbasis of Â: 

	Â|φᵢ> = Aᵢ|φᵢ>

	Â' = (Σᵤ |u><φᵤ|) Â (Σᵥ |φᵥ><v|)
	Â' = Σᵤᵥ |u><φᵤ| Aᵥ |φᵥ><v|
	Â' = Σᵤᵥ Aᵥ |u><φᵤ|φᵥ><v|
	Â' = Σᵤ Aᵤ |u><u|
	
	Tr Â' = Σᵢ Aᵢ.

We see that our basis-independent trace is basis-independent precisely because
it is the sum of the eigenvalues, which are of course also basis-independent.

We can also derive, with our cyclic result and our linearity result, the 
quantum result for conservation of A:

	d<A>/dt = d/dt Tr ρ Â = Tr (∂ρ/∂t Â + ρ ∂Â/∂t)
	i ħ d<A>/dt = Tr (Ĥ ρ Â − ρ Ĥ Â + i ħ ρ ∂Â/∂t)
	i ħ d<A>/dt = Tr (Ĥ ρ Â) + Tr(-ρ Ĥ Â + i ħ ρ ∂Â/∂t)
	i ħ d<A>/dt = Tr (ρ Â Ĥ) + Tr(-ρ Ĥ Â + i ħ ρ ∂Â/∂t)
	i ħ d<A>/dt = < Â Ĥ − Ĥ Â + i ħ ∂Â/∂t >

In the "Schrödinger picture," which we have been using, ρ is changing and 
generally Â is constant, so that this reduces to just:

	i ħ d<A>/dt = < [Â, Ĥ] >

There is another, older "picture", the "Heisenberg picture", where the matrices 
change while the states remain the same. In this picture, ∂ρ/∂t = 0 and:

	i ħ ∂Â/∂t = [Â, Ĥ]

...so as to give the exact same result as in the Schrödinger picture of quantum 
mechanics. This Heisenberg picture is very counterintuitive: if you will allow 
me to be a little dramatic, it states that the wavefunction of the universe 
is actually exactly the same as it was in the big bang, and that all life and
change and so forth occurs because the /definitions of space and momentum/ are
somehow changing against this constant background. Whether you feel that this
is *metaphysically true* or not, the mathematics says that you can't tell the 
*physical difference*: and this can sometimes help with complicated physics 
problems: because the system starts and ends in the ground state. 

# Coupled systems #
We have seen that we can rewrite quantum mechanics so as to not use |Ψ>, but
rather ρ = |Ψ><Ψ|, as our physical state. Thus we have adequacy conditions on 
ρ: ρ is a Hermitian matrix with trace 1; its diagonal entries are all positive
real numbers. And these density matrices generate quantum mechanics via:

	i ħ ∂ρ/∂t = Ĥ ρ − ρ Ĥ
	<A> = Tr ρ Â

It is important to understand that some ρ fulfil the adequacy conditions but
are not seperable as |Ψ><Ψ|. For example, for a 2-level system {|0>, |1>}, the 
quantum mechanics allows a general state of:

	|Ψ> = cos(θ/2) |0> + sin(θ/2) e^{iφ} |1>
	
	|Ψ><Ψ| = ½ [  1 + cos θ     e^{-iφ} sin θ ]
	           [ e^{iφ} sin θ     1 − cos θ   ]

For example:
	 |+><+| = ½ [ 1  1 ]  ,  |−><−| = ½ [ 1  -1 ]
                [ 1  1 ]                [-1   1 ]

Here is an adequate matrix which violates this general form:

	ρ = [ ½ 0 ]
		[ 0 ½ ]

But, notice that this is nothing more than a linear combination of matrices 
which *do* obey the general form:

	ρ = ½ |0><0| + ½ |1><1| = ½ |+><+| + ½ |−><−|

In general, Σᵢ qᵢ ρᵢ satisfies the adequacy conditions as long as the qᵢ are 
nonnegative real numbers which sum to 1: in other words, they form a classical
probability vector. 

We now want to discuss a situation where we take the composition of two Hilbert 
spaces A = {|i>} and B = {|a>}. We write the joint Hilbert space as {|ia>}. An operator Â which acts 
only on system A will therefore have a matrix: 

	Â |va> = Σᵢ Aᵢᵥ |ia>

...with just two indexes and leaving the second component of the space unchanged. Meanwhile our state must complexify to the system:

	|Ψ> = Σᵥₐ cᵥₐ |va>
	<Ψ| = Σᵤₐ cᵤₐ* <ua|

...with now two different systems to index over. Combining our expressions for Â |va> and |Ψ> gives us the expectation value:

	<A> = <Ψ|Â|Ψ> = Σₐᵢᵤᵥ Aᵢᵥ cᵥₐ cᵤₐ* <ua|ia>
	<A> = <Ψ|Â|Ψ> = Σₐᵤᵥ Aᵤᵥ cᵥₐ cᵤₐ*

At this point, we turn to an example of the general idea. Suppose we have two two-level systems (two qubits) and we want to describe their combined state, in their combined Hilbert space. We just asked the question, "can we still describe single-qubit operators?" and our answer was "yes, sure." But now it's worth asking: can we describe only the state of the first qubit of |Ψ> without the second one? The answer is, "not with a wavefunction". Two separate qubits would have a state which looks like this:

	(a |0> + b |1>)[A] (c |0> + d |1>)[B]
	= ac |00> + ad |01> + bc |10> + bd |11>

...and it thus has to obey this property:

	c₀₀ c₁₁ = c₀₁ c₁₀.

Here is an example of a state which does not obey this property and therefore cannot be separated into two single-qubit states:

	|Ψ> = a |00> + b |11>

In this case c₀₁ c₁₀ = 0, but c₀₀ c₁₁ = ab, which is not 0 except in the special trivial cases |Ψ> = |00> and |Ψ> = |11>.

This state is called an 'entangled state': because if you measure the first qubit as 0, then the state is |00> and you must measure the second qubit as 0; but if you measure the first as 1, then the state is |11> and you must measure the second as 1. 

However, you /can/ describe the state of the first qubit with a /density matrix/, where you cannot describe it with a wavefunction. Here is the expectation value formula that we obtained:

	<A> = Σₐᵤᵥ Aᵤᵥ cᵥₐ cᵤₐ*

We can see that the density sub-matrix needed is simply:

	σᵥᵤ = Σₐ cᵥₐ cᵤₐ*

And then this is:

	<A> = Σᵤᵥ Aᵤᵥ σᵥᵤ = Tr σ A 

More importantly, we see that the expression for σ is /itself/ a trace operation over the subsystem B:

	σ = Σₐ <a| ρ |a>

To get the subsystem's density matrix, you "trace out" all of the parts of the supersystem that you don't care about, and you can describe the subsystem succinctly by the above density matrix. 

In our example, our nonseparable 2-qubit state was:

	|Ψ> = a |00> + b |11>

Its density matrix, while a little complicated, is:

	ρ = aa* |00><00| + ab* |00><11| + ba* |11><00| + bb* |11><11|

To trace this out, we remove any terms which don't survive the tracing-out operation <0| ρ |0> + <1| ρ |1> on the second qubit:

	σ = aa* |0><0| + bb* |1><1|

We've thus come full circle on coupled systems: our earlier problem with  density matrices has been revealed as a small aspect of quantum entanglement: you /can/ achieve those states when your qubits entangle with their environment. 

Notice also that this system has no "coherence terms" |0><1| or |1><0|, which if you'll recall entered into our normal one-qubit density matrix as:

	½ e^{±iφ} sin θ

This fact -- that "entanglement destroys coherence" -- is the fundamental idea of the double-slit experiment.

# The Double-Slit Experiment #

We send particles, one at a time, through a slit, and then we let them travel to hit a detection screen. The result is that we observe a pattern, which I'll say is in the y-direction. With just one slit, this pattern is perhaps a bell curve or so. I will just treat the arbitrary case, as it's simpler to write. 

In the case of bullets sent through a well-armored slit, you would expect the description to look like this: the distribution going through slit 0 is f₀(y), the distribution through slit 1 is f₁(y), and when you open both slits, the curve you get should be:

	g(y) = ½ f₀(y) + ½ f₁(y)

On the other hand, when a classical wave passes through such a slit, we know that there is some wave, which we symbolize as a phasor rotating in the complex plane. We see the one-slit patterns |z₀(y)|², and |z₁(y)|², and when it passes through both, we see ½ |z₀(y) + z₁(y)|². 

We now treat the quantum case. Depending on which slit the particle goes through, we mark its state at that exact moment as |0> or |1>; of course, it could be in a superposition. The point is, it is a two-level Hilbert space: a qubit. As it travels from the slits to the screen it evolves over space in the y-direction. We can describe its evolution as a linear evolution of each of its components:

	|0> → |z₀(η)>
	|1> → |z₁(η)>

This produces a new Hilbert space parametrized by the y-axis via the coordinate η. Our observable is going to observe this y-coordinate itself, i.e. "is the y-coordinate η equal to some specific y?":

	ŷ = δ(η − y)
	<α|ŷ|β> = ∫ dη α*(η) δ(η − y) β(η) = α*(y) β(y)

Thus, in our original basis, we can define this whole process by an analogous operator Â, which works exactly as you would (hopefully) expect:

	<u|Â|v> = Aᵤᵥ = zᵤ*(y) zᵥ(y)

Our "observable" in the double-slit experiment is therefore the matrix:

	Â = [ |z₀|²    z₀* z₁ ]
	    [ z₀ z₁*    |z₁|² ]

In the state |Ψ> = |0>, we have <A> = |z₀|², while in the state |Ψ> = |1>, we have <A> = |z₁|². 
	
But in the state |+> = √½ |0> + √½ |1>, we would observe:

	<A> = ½[|z₀|² + z₀* z₁ + z₀ z₁* + |z₁|²] = ½ |z₀ + z₁|².

The double slit experiment, of course, does not end there: this is just the basic first result: When you fire electrons at the two slits, they act like the wave does, not like the bullets do.

Now you decide to change the experiment by measuring which slit the electron goes through, trying to make it tell you "the electron is, for sure, a wave." This is done by some well-designed measurement apparatus which would say "0" if the qubit was in state |0> and "1" if the qubit was |1>. The key here is that this apparatus amounts to a two-level system -- another qubit. We go from the state:

	|Ψ> = √½ |0> +  √½ |1>

To a new, two-qubit state:

	|Ψ> = √½ |00> +  √½ |11>

Here the first qubit is the original qubit, and the second is our measurement apparatus, which tells us either "it went through slit 0" or "it went through slit 1." We have designed it well, so that whenever the system goes through a slit, the device gives us the correct result. 

If we "trace out" the measurement apparatus and ask for the new state of the first qubit, we see that it is exactly: 

	σ = [½ 0] = ½.
		[0 ½]

We thus have that:

	<A> = Tr σ Â = ½ Tr Â = ½ |z₀|² + ½ |z₁|²

...in other words, we see the exact result that we got for the bullets, rather than the result that we got for the waves. Both distributions add together in the bullet sense f + g, rather than the wave sense |f + g|². 

# Measurement and Interpretations #

I want to point out something absolutely crucial: in /none/ of the above discussion have we discussed what happens during a measurement. In the double-slit observable, if we use, say, photons: you have a photomultiplier tube at a point y, and you measure their probability to enter that photomultiplier tube with the above <A>. But something peculiar still happens: if you start measuring with two tubes, and your photon intensity is low, you see measurements in either one or the other tube, not both.

This is very important for you to understand, because it prevents Quantum Mechanics from being a pure wave theory of phenomena, and it has something to do with everything. For example, televisions. Perhaps I can keep my television in two places: either my living room or my bedroom. We can describe TV-in-Bedroom as the state |B> and TV-in-Living-Room as the state |L>. Quantum mechanics allows us to form the superposition state:

	|Ψ> = √½ |L> +  √½ |B>

Quantum mechanics also, as we have seen, describes what happens as air molecules and light in both rooms bounce against the superimposed television: it decays into a classical probabilistic superposition:

	ρ = ½ L + ½ B
	
	(where L = |L><L| and B = |B><B|).

But: this is not what we see! We do not see my television as half in my bedroom and half in my living room -- not unless it has somehow been cut in half or so. It's either in one or the other. Schrödinger famously described a similar case with a cat: quantum mechanics allows a certain superposition state of "live cat" and "dead cat" in a closed box, but of course we always see a cat as alive or dead when we open it.

The unitary, simple, clean wave theory is sufficient to describe the dual-slit experiment result above. It's not about "wave-particle duality" or "the measurment problem," or anything of the sort. Those do form a significant problem, sure: but they are not the problem with the double-slit experiment.

The problem of measurement, and the particle side of wave-particle duality, can be added to our above description as a sort of axiom:

	When we measure an observable, we observe an eigenstate of that observable's operator. Moreover, repeated measurements are /consistent/: if we measure X, then shortly after, if we measure again, we will again see X.

The problem is that we have a very high-level understanding of measurement -- we know when we have performed one -- but this does not work well with our low-level understanding of quantum mechanics. To solve this problem, there are many "quantum mechanics interpretations," which try to create a /metaphysical model/ of quantum mechanics, so as to explain the fact that we only see superpositions in repeated experiments, and not in any individual one. 

The most popular "interpretation" is the Copenhagen interpretation, sometimes called "wavefunction collapse." It says that the act of looking for my television will itself force the wavefunction of my television to undergo a discontinuity, "collapsing" to either the L or the B state. In other words, wavefunctions are real, but the act of observation somehow discontinuously changes the wavefunction to a new eigenstate. I would say that this is the most straightforward method out, given the known facts: you insist on the reality of the wavefunction, you insist that it's changing over time, and you insist that the repeated-consistency criterion implies the collapse to the eigenstate.

But we have not here described what an observation means at the lowest level; we still don't know when the cat's life or death is "observed" or whether it can observe itself. Along these lines, we might worry about the paradox of nested observation: an experimenter measures a qubit and either shouts "0!" or "1!" -- we now put this whole experiment, including the experimenter, in a box and describe it as two two-level systems -- the qubit and the experimenter. Who collapses the qubit -- the experimenter inside the box, or the experimenter outside the box?

Another popular one is the many-worlds interpretation, which states that the wavefunction does not describe something real to our universe, but describes a distribution of the cat, television, or other qubit across many parallel universes which all "came from" our present. Our conscious experience somehow selects one of these futures to follow -- we don't always know quite how -- and we observe the television in the living room or the bedroom as befits the universe that we actually find ourselves in. 

You can, in fact, do quantum mechanics purely deterministically -- indeed, the wave-part of the theory is totally deterministic, so you simply need a deterministic account of collapse. This is furnished by several different methods, whether they might be a "guiding equation" or a sort of "surface appearance" which obeys quantum mechanical statistics by some deterministic equation. 

Why do we care? What real experiment is at stake when we add measurement into our discussion? What /quantum/ effect can measurement have?

# The Quantum Eraser Experiment #

We take the dual-slit experiment, with its two entangled qubits: the interference pattern has disappeared due to the measurement, and it is as if we are watching bullets, rather than waves, travelling through our two slits.

What if I could measure another qubit in another box, far away from the original experiment, to make the system behave like waves again? The other system would have to be entangled with this present system, sure: but we could do it. Here's how.

In our dual-slit experiment, we could say that there was a "before measurement" state, where we will say that the measurement apparatus simply said "slit 0":

	√½ |00> + √½ |10>

And it "turned into" the state:

	√½ |00> + √½ |11>

The operation being applied here can be described as a "CNOT" operation:

	|00> → |00>
	|01> → |01>
	|10> → |11>
	|11> → |10>

It flips the second bit, if and only if the first bit is 1. We will apply that operation in our new system. The only difference is that we start our measurement apparatus not in the neutral state |0> but in an entangled state with a third qubit:

	|Ψ> = ( √½ |0> + √½ |1> ) (√½ |00> + √½ |11>)
	|Ψ> = ½ |000> + ½ |011> + ½ |100> + ½ |111>

Here is how we might realize this system: we create two photons with entangled polarizations: polarizations can be either up-down or left-right, which makes them a perfect two-level system. We send one of those photons through a double-slit. The first qubit is which slit it went through, the second qubit is the slit-photon's polarization, and the third qubit is the other-photon's polarization.

If you trace out the second and third qubits, you do indeed now get the density matrix |+><+|, as we got above. The pattern beyond the slit will now be a wave pattern.

We now apply the CNOT gate, which in this case rotates the polarization of any photon which goes through slit 1 by 90 degrees, so that up-down becomes left-right and vice versa. Applying our rule of "flip the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is 1," we get:

	|Ψ> = ½ |000> + ½ |011> + ½ |110> + ½ |101>

We trace out the second and third qubits of this density matrix. You don't actually have to write out the 16 terms and trace it out: the four states each have different values for the second qubits, and thus the trace only "grabs" each term's density-matrix-component with itself. If you do out the maths, you get:

	σ = ½ |0><0| + ½ |1><1|

...and thus the wave pattern has disappeared. I want to emphasize: we do /not/ observe the polarization anywhere in this experiment yet. The polarization is merely entangled with the slit that the photon went through. All we did is to rotate the polarization of one slit, and the interference pattern disappeared. We /could/ have measured this pattern with an up-down or left-right polarization filter placed between the two slits and the observation screen, but it's not strictly necessary.

Here is the weird fact, though. We can rewrite the above state with the third qubit, but instead of labeling it as |0> and |1>. we can use the |+> and |-> basis:

	|0> = √½ |+> + √½ |−>
	|1> = √½ |+> − √½ |−>
	
	|Ψ> = ½ √½ [|00+> + |00−> + |01+> − |01−> + |11+> + |11−> + |10+> − |10−>]

Collect together the |+> and the |−> terms to see that:

	|Ψ> =  ½ √½ [ |00> + |01> + |10> + |11> ] |+> 
		+  ½ √½ [ |00> − |01> − |10> + |11> ] |−>

But, the terms in square brackets are just 2 |++> and 2 |−−> respectively, and thus:

	|Ψ> = √½ |+++> + √½ |−−−>

If you like, we can see this retroactively: the states |+++> and |−−−> both contain every binary number from |000> to |111>, except that the state |−−−> contains a − sign in front of every state with an odd number of 1's in it. The state that we just wrote down for |Ψ> : 

	½ |000> + ½ |011> + ½ |110> + ½ |101>

...contains only the four terms with an even number of 1's, all with + signs: it is thus |+++> + |−−−>.

Here is where this gets weird. We measure the third qubit as either |+> or |−>, by placing a polarizer rotated at 45 degrees between the up-down and left-right states. If you prefer, you can instead rotate the entangled photon so that, say, |+> becomes |0> and |−> becomes |1>, and then measure up-down or left-right in the "computational basis" of |0> and |1>. It doesn't really matter which you choose: the photon will either pass through, or it won't pass through. In that moment, you will collapse the whole state to either |+++> or |−−−>.

At this point, the first qubit is either in the state |+> or |−>, and therefore the slits show an interference pattern either way.

Here's the absolutely crazy part, where measurement does something totally unexpected: we have managed to create apparatuses which delay this choice of "do I measure qubit 3?" until /after/ qubit 1 has registered on the screen. Now, we can't wait forever, because the above decoherence effect happens with all sorts of noise. In particular, we don't have apparatuses which will let us wait for 30 seconds or so before observing qubit 3, so we can't "peek" at qubit 1 before trying to influence qubit 3. But we have managed to use one-nanosecond detectors to do the detections, with an eight-nanosecond delay between observation of the interference pattern and observation of qubit 3. Our notions of time and causality are /not/ respected by quantum mechanics, which gives you the consistent results that you expect from the mathematics: when you measure qubit 3, you get an interference pattern; when you don't measure qubit 3, it disappears.
