# Thermodynamics and Evolution

As a physicist, I've been asked a couple of times about a very particular class
of arguments against evolution, which assert that the biological theory of 
evolution is in some sense or another <em>thermodynamically impossible</em>. 
Some of these arguments couch themselves in the terms of information theory, 
while others appeal to the laws of thermodynamics directly: all of them state 
that evolution is indefensible because, as it were, "something can't come from nothing." 

- Design does not require an intelligent designer.
- Claim: new information requires an intelligent agent to design.
	- Rebuttal: computers.
		- Objection: The software is designed by intelligent agents.
			- Observation: This means that you just require a "halo" of 
				intelligence to be passed on.
			- Decisive counter-rebuttal: evolutionary algorithms work.
				- Only require the output specifications; the rest is a black-
					box abstraction.
- Claim: evolution violates 2nd law of thermodynamics.
	- Rebuttal: refrigerators.
