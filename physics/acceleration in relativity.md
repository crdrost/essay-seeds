# Acceleration in Special Relativity

I've sometimes heard that you can't do accelerations in special relativity, and
I think that this is one of the reasons that the ideas in special relativity 
seem so difficult to grasp. It's not the only reason, but they keep coming up.
For example, all the time there are these cosmic particles with energies 
~10^18 eV and higher hitting our planet, called "cosmic rays". The proton rest 
mass is only 10^9 eV, so this means that such particles have a relativistic Î³ 
of about 10^9. But the Earth is only 6371 km in radius -- only about 10^7 m in 
diameter -- so that this means that these particles, as they come in, see the 
Earth as only about 1cm wide in their reference frames. Do they even see the 
Earth rotate? And what do they think is going on when the Earth *does* rotate? 

The standard special relativity answer: "rotation is a kind of acceleration,
we can't do that with our mathematics."

So I would like to go through, for my own sake, the mathematics of acceleration
within relativity.
