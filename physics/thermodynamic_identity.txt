The most important equation in thermodynamics can be summarized in one neat 
little form, the first law of thermodynamics. It says that reversible processes
obey the equation:

    δE = T δS − P δV + Σᵢ μᵢ δNᵢ

It says that the internal energy of a set of particles in a box changes only
if the volume of the box changes, the entropy of the particles changes, or
the number of particles of a given type Nᵢ changes. These changes relate to 
the internal energy by certain thermodynamic quantities: For entropy, it is
temperature; for volume, it is pressure, for particle number, it is the 
chemical potential of that particle. Systems which are allowed to trade 
volume, particles, or energy will equalize their pressure, chemical potential,
or temperature, respectively. This fact is contained in the above equation by
the so-called second law of thermodynamics:

    A system at constant energy, volume, and number of particles -- an 
    isolated system -- comes to a maximum of entropy.

The first law is a statement about reversible changes; the second law is a 
statement about irreversible ones: you can see this by trying to naively apply
the second law to the first one, where you get that, if volume, number of 
particles, and energy are constant, then δS = 0. But they both work together
in the sense that at a maximum of entropy, δS is indeed zero, thus the first
law does indeed 'get it right' in the end. Still, the second law helps for 
looking at nonequilibrium processes. 

This implies the above statements about equal pressure in a very simple way. 
Imagine two boxes which can exchange volume with each other in a box with fixed 
volume:

    +------+---------------+
    |      |               |
    |  V₁  |      V₂       |
    |  S₁  |      S₂       |
    |      |               |
    +------+---------------+
    S = S₁ + S₂
    V₁ + V₂ = constant

The wall in the center is allowed to "slide" from one to the other. 
    
At constant energy and number of particles in those two boxes, the first law 
simply states:

    T δS − P δV = 0

    (∂S/∂V)_{E, Nᵢ} = P/T.

Thus if we keep E and Nᵢ constant, ∂S/∂V = P/T. If we now allow a little volume
δV to flow from V₁ to V₂, the result changes the total system entropy S by:

    δS = − δV (∂S₁/∂V₁) + δV (∂S₂/∂V₂) = δV [P₂/T₂ − P₁/T₁]

At the equilibrium, this will be at a maximum entropy state, and thus δS = 0:

    P₂/T₂ = P₁/T₁ at equilibrium.

If the sliding wall between them isn't insulating, then a similar thing happens
when they are allowed to exchange an energy δQ: 

    δS = − δQ (∂S₁/∂E₁) + δQ (∂S₂/∂E₂) = δQ [1/T₂ − 1/T₁]
    
    1/T₂ = 1/T₁ at equilibrium.

Thus it comes to an equilibrium where temperatures and pressures between the
two boxes equalize. More importantly, it implies this powerful statement:
    
    δS = δQ [1/T₂ − 1/T₁]
    δS > 0, δQ > 0:
    1/T₂ − 1/T₁ > 0
    T₁ > T₂.

Remember that δQ is an energy flowing from system 1 to 2, and this requirement
that δQ > 0 we're making implies T₁ > T₂. If δQ is negative, then heat flows 
from 2 to 1, and this flips the inequality: T₁ < T₂. Thus we come to the more
common form in which the Second Law of Thermodynamics is stated:

    In an isolated system, heat always flows from hot to cold, and never 
    flows from cold to hot.
    
Notice the crucial idea of an "isolated system": This law **does not** 
prohibit something like a refrigerator from functioning, but it requires that
a refrigerator must consume some sort of electrical or mechanical energy in 
order to function -- it cannot function with no input. In fact, I will derive
a maximum efficiency on refrigerators which this bound implies.

The first law in its form is also helpful to understand the Legendre transforms
of the internal energy variable. The easiest example is when we want to look at
a system with constant pressure, rather than constant volume. This works like 
so: in a constant pressure situation, V₂ is so much larger than V₁ that any 
change in the volume of V₁ does not change the pressure of V₂ much at all. You
may, if you like, imagine that V₂ is the atmosphere of the Earth while V₁ is 
something which is rapidly expanding -- a balloon or so -- within that 
atmosphere. Since the atmosphere sets a common pressure, we would like to 
use a different "thermodynamic potential" which tells us how much energy we can
get, given that this thing will change in volume to keep a constant pressure.

This is not so hard as it looks. You just introduce the Enthalpy:

    H = E + P V

...and then take its differential with the product rule from calculus:

    δH = δE + P δV + V δP

...and then use the thermodynamic identity for δE, canceling the terms ± P δV:

    δH = T δS + V δP + Σᵢ μᵢ δNᵢ

Thus the enthalpy remains unchanged as long as entropy, pressure, and particle
numbers are unchanged. At constant pressure, the enthalpy is the right 
"thermodynamic potential" for calculating energy differences. For an ideal gas:

    P V = n R T
    E = α n R T

The specific heat at constant volume is just:

    C_v = (1/n) (∂E/∂T) = α R

But the specific heat at constant pressure is more like:

    H = E + P V = (α + 1) n R T
    C_p = (1/n) (∂H/∂T) = (α + 1) R.

Thus there is a useful number to know called the specific heat ratio:

    γ = C_p / C_v = (α + 1)/α = 1 + 1/α. 

Why is this useful? Well, it enters into the formula for an adiabatic process:

    adiabatic process: δS = 0, δNᵢ = 0
    
    δE + P δV = 0
    
This quantity δE + P δV is sometimes called δQ, the "heat flow", which is why 
this is called an adiabatic ("constant heat") process. It is a fundamentally 
reversible process due to δS = 0. Using the ideal gas equation gives:
    
    E = α P V,
    δE = α (P δV + V δP)

    (α + 1) P δV + α V δP = 0
    (α + 1) δV/V = - α δP/P

Integrating gives:
    
    γ log(V) = -log(P) + log(C)
    V^γ = C / P
    P V^γ = constant.

This is the equation for any adiabatic process.

It is possible to have another sort of reversible process, other than the 
adiabatic process. This is based on the observation that the fundamental thing
banned by the Second Law is heat flowing from a cold reservoir to a hot 
reservoir, and inferring that heat flowing from a hot reservoir to a cold one
is the reverse: an irreversible shift. This limits the options: the reversible
processes are those where heat does not flow (adiabatic processes), or where 
heat flows, but the temperature of both systems is the same (isothermal 
processes). In an isothermal process, we have yet another thermodynamic 
potential to consider, the Helmholtz free energy A:
    
    A = E − T S
    δA = -S δT − P δV + Σᵢ μᵢ δNᵢ
    
Again, this represents how much energy is available at constant temperature. 
There is also a Gibbs free energy at constant temperature and pressure:
    
    G = E − T S + P V
    δG = V δP − S δT  + Σᵢ μᵢ δNᵢ

...and there are also (e.g. in chemistry and in solid state physics) sometimes 
times where you will subtract μₐ Nₐ for various compounds a to represent that
the system is able to exchange particles with, say, a large environment which 
is a solution with a constant density of those particles. They're all just the
Legendre transforms of that one basic equation. 

For an ideal gas, isothermal processes are a good deal simpler, because:
    
    PV = n R T

Thus an isothermal process for an ideal gas is just one where PV = constant.

There are therefore two reversible processes on an ideal gas, and we can use 
them to construct a reversible heat pump: an ideal gas system which can either
be run forwards or backwards with the same efficiency. This is called a Carnot
engine or a Carnot cycle, and it is extremely important for a simple reason:
the second law guarantees that it is the most efficient engine possible. 

Why? Well, suppose you had a hyperefficient heat engine H and a Carnot engine 
C. Hook them up between two reservoirs at different temperatures like so:
    
    +---------------------------+
    |           T_hot           |
    +---+---+-----------+---+---+
        | | |           |/|\|
        ( H ) ==> W ==> ( C ) 
        |\|/|           | | |
    +---+---+-----------+---+---+
    |           T_cold          |
    +---------------------------+

You see, the Carnot engine can be reversed, which is what we're doing here. The
work done by the superefficient engine drives the Carnot engine to pull heat
from the cold reservoir into the hot one. Since H is more efficient than C, the
result is that there is some extra work W, and thus some extra heat going from
cold to hot. over what is going from hot to cold. It follows that we have 
broken the second law; heat is flowing from cold to hot in an isolated system.
The second law therefore forbids anything from being more efficient than a 
reversible process, and so reversible motors have optimal efficiency.

As mentioned before, the work of a system is P dV, so the work for our ideal 
gas reversible engine is given by a couple of integrals. With the adiabatic
process we have:
    
    T δS = δE + P δV = 0
    
    W = ∫ P dV = -(E₁ − E₀) = - α n R (T₁ − T₀)

The crucil lesson is that the adiabatic process basically just serves the 
purpose of shifting the temperature of the engine so that it can do its 
isothermal processes; it does not do any net work (because the return path will
have these temperatures reversed), nor does it absorb any heat from either of
the reservoirs, nor does it change the entropy.

You can also work out this expression from P V^γ = constant, if you like.

For an isothermal change the integral is instead:

    δE = 0
    T δS = δE + P δV = P δV
    W = ∫ P dV = ∫ T dS = T (S₁ − S₀)
    
or, if you prefer:
    
    W = ∫ P dV = ∫ n R T dV/V = n R T log(V₁ / V₀).

Either is correct, but I will use the first because it saves me from long 
reasonings of the form P₁ V₁^γ = P₄ V₄^γ. 

As we travel across an adiabatic process we have in the simplest case two 
adiabatic and two isothermal processes, with 4 switching points between them:

    1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1
    (P₁, V₁) → (P₂, V₂) → (P₃, V₃) → (P₄, V₄) → (P₁, V₁)

We will say that  1 and 2 are both at temperature T₁, 3 and 4 are both at 
temperature T₀, 1 and 3 are both at entropy S₀, and 2 and 4 are both at entropy
S₁. Thus our cycle looks like:

    (T₁, S₀) → (T₁, S₁) → (T₀, S₁) → (T₀, S₀) → (T₁, S₀)

The work in the full cycle is just the sum of the works:
    
    W = T₁ (S₁ − S₀) − α n R (T₀ − T₁) + T₀ (S₀ − S₁) − α n R (T₁ − T₀)

The adiabatic work cancels itself exactly out and:
    
    W = (T₁ − T₀)(S₁ − S₀) = (T₁ − T₀) n R log(V₂ / V₁)

This enables us to do a quick calculation of the efficiency as just:
    
    ε = W / Q₁

The trick is to realize that the heat extracted from the bath at T₁ is all 
extracted in the 1 → 2 transition when it is turned directly (isothermally) 
into the work T₁ (S₁ − S₀). Thus:
    
    ε = [(T₁ − T₀)(S₁ − S₀)] / [T₁ (S₁ − S₀)] = (T₁ − T₀)/T₁ = 1 − T₀/T₁
    
This is the maximum efficiency which any engine can provide from a hot material
to a cold exhaust. 

A refrigerator efficiency might be written analogously by assuming a negative
work, and thus a negative Q₀ and Q₁. Whereas the heat engine efficiency was 
defined as (work output) / (heat input), our refrigerator efficiency is 
(heat removed from 0) / (work done), which is just:
    
    εᵣ = T₀ (S₁ − S₀) / [(T₁ − T₀)(S₁ − S₀)] = T₀ / (T₁ − T₀).
    
If we connected a Carnot engine to a Carnot refrigerator, the first would take
in a heat Q from the hot reservoir and exhaust a heat Q T₀/T₁ to the cold 
reservoir, doing a work W = Q (T₁ − T₀)/T₁. The refrigerator would then pull 
out an energy W εᵣ = Q T₀/T₁ from the cold reservoir and exhaust the heat
Q (T₁ − T₀)/T₁ + Q T₀/T₁ = Q back into the hot reservoir: in all, no net change
would have happened. Basically, if you disconnected the refrigerator to allow
the engine to start moving, and then connected the two, the engine would keep
whatever kinetic energy it had (until friction slowed it down) without moving
any heat or doing any net work, just moving heat from the hot reservoir to the
hot reservoir again.

So we come full circle. A Carnot engine is perfectly reversible and therefore
has the maximum efficiency allowed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This
efficiency is essentially the same in either refrigerator or heat engine form, 
but we define the two differently and get a subtly different equation for iit 
in either case. The easiest-to-remember form is:
    
    ε = 1 − T₀/T₁.

A nice quote from Wikipedia can round this out with an example:

So for example, these sorts of industrial steam turbines get close to:
    
    1 - 303 K / 838 K = 0.638 = 64%

...but older engines without contents under pressure had to deal with 100°C 
boiling water on one hand, and perhaps a 30°C environment. Converting to 
Kelvin, this gives:
    
    1 − 303 K / 373 K = 0.187 = 19%.
