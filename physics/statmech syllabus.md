I'd like to compile a nice statistical mechanics course but I'm not sure what it would include.

Day 1: "most important"/"wizard hat" lecture first.

>  Calculus, phase space, statistical notion of entropy, thermodynamic definitions of temperature and pressure, ideal gas formula, Einstein solid formula.

Day 2: Review of Hamiltonian mechanics, the phase-space ontology, time reversal symmetries and their limitations. 

Other topics I'd need to cover:
    
* drag forces and their micromechanical origins
* energy minimization, equilibrium and relaxation times
* entropic forces, models of the atmosphere and hydrostatic equilibrium
* Paramagnets, Einstein solids, Sackur-Tetrode gas entropy.
* diffusion
* Carnot cycle and its efficiency
* Boltzmann factors, legendre transforms, free energies
* The Ising model
* Why stat.mech. and Quantum Mechanics fit naturally together, Planck's law, Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein.
    * How QFT problems also appear in stat mech, Gould and Tobochnik ch. 8:
        http://www.compadre.org/STP/document/ServeFile.cfm?ID=7946&DocID=685
* The H theorem, densities of states?
* Maxwell's demon, Gibb's paradox, etc?
* Equipartition theorem.
* phase transitions, critical points, renormalization groups?
* Perpetual motion and Feynman's ratchet.
    * This I would like to integrate to the Carnot cycle lecture, at least partly. I'd like to explain Carnot cycles by imagining a bucket which can transfer water between two different reservoirs at different heights, and the reversibility condition of the bucket thus places limits on the "efficiency" of either the "refrigerator" or the "heat engine". 


The last lecture: more whimsical topics?

* Black holes, entropy, and cosmology?
* Stellar collapse and the Chandrasekhar limit, neutron stars as pulsars
