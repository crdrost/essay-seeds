Conscious phenomena that remind me of QM:

- Free Will
	- We all feel, in all of our decisions, "I didn't have to do X, I could have done Y." If we don't make up our minds and choose among our alternatives, then that itself becomes a choice to be consumed with indecision.
	- Reminds me of measurement.
		- The "measurement problem" really asks how a particle is 'guided by' its wavefunction, which is spread across many states, and yet we only observe discrete states with no mixing.
		- QM allows a state for my television of 50% bedroom, 50% living room, but we never see this sort of state; the television comes to be either 100% in the living room or 100% in the bedroom.
    - One hyper-relevant aspect: "making up our minds" comes to us as a quantized thing. We can be indecisive for a while but we can force ourselves to make decisions, which have definite barriers. There is a level in our heads where we are 50/50 and then another level where we go 100%.
- Intentionality
	- How do we think "about" a cat if that cat doesn't exist? And how can "aboutness" be both objective (I am thinking about a cat) and subjective (this book is about cats)?
	- Reminds me of entanglement.
		- Another fuzzy connection between system A and system B where the state of B correlates with the state of A.
		- In principle, if your physical senses are pretty good, your perceptions should anyway be quantum-entangled with a mess of photons coming off of the perceived object, and thus, via entanglement, one comes to understand the other's existence.
- Unification
	- Why/how do our perceptions all come together as one conscious whole? Why is it that when I look at a chair I am aware that there are other things in the "corner of my eyes" which I am not paying attention to? Why is it that I don't see my blind spot?
	- Reminds me of Cooper Pairs.
		- Quantum mechanics allows for electrons with opposite momentum to come together, in certain metals called "superconductors", by an electron-phonon interaction. (Basically, if they don't come together, they deform the atomic lattice with much more energy than they repel themselves together.)
		- This "Cooper pair" of electrons can be treated with quantum mechanics as well, which states that it will form a Bose-Einstein condensate at lower temperatures, which we observe (as superconductivity). 
		- Lots of mental effort has been spent (wasted?) on the fact that these electrons are moving in opposite directions and so on, and so how do they move charge? et cetera. But they do act as if they have combined into a new joint entity. 
Collapse:
    We have two pictures of the electron. In one, it takes on a fuzzy, stable orbit of an atom, delocalized, and sometimes its only angular momentum comes from its intrinsic spin, rather than from orbital angular momentum. This is the Hydrogen atom picture. But in the other one, we fire an electron through a nonlinear magnetic field and then we receive a discrete "ping" in one of two detectors, corresponding to whether it had spin "up" or spin "down" -- other detectors along the same axis do not fire; only two for equal and opposite spinniness.
    The connection between these is held to be *measurement*, which in quantum mechanics displays an odd nonlinear character, at least in the Copenhagen interpretation. The best competition with this comes from Everett, who insists on the linearity of quantum mechanics and the nonlinearity of the human path through the quantum universe -- I observe spin-up, but only because I happened to follow a consciousness trajectory into a state which was entangled with the spin-up state.
    Another connection is furnished by *decoherence*, which says that in the linear part of quantum mechanics, some qualitative shift in wavefunctions occurs when entanglement does.
    The connection that I wish to draw at the moment deals with the general nonlinearity of change -- the 'arrow of time' problem. Why is it that, with so many time-reversal-symmetries in the physical laws, we still see time progress in a certain entropy-increasing order?

-- fractals? --
Maybe the single most important mathematical breakthrough in our modern era was the invention of self-similarity down to infinity in the form of fractal mathematics. At the same time, QM has remained clean, linear, unbroken by this. 

At the same time, I have a hint that consciousness is probably fractal at some level. See, it seems clear to me that if you froze a brain in time -- created some "suspended animation" -- that it would cease to feel things. If that's true, then consciousness is not directly induced by geometry, but has deep ties to *process* -- it is the *dance* which is conscious, and if you stop the dance, you stop the consciousness, even when the matter and linkages and interrelationships live on.

The reason why this is fractal has to do with the unificationism mentioned before. Different qualitative aspects like sight and sound fundamentally "come together" in the conscious process: I would not be unconscious if you emoved my sight-stimulus at some level, even though that aspect of me would have disappeared from "the dance". So the dance of consciousness recurs, even when I shrink it by removing vision. In this sense, the "building blocks" of consciousness are probably very simple dances.

But I've occasionally wondered whether this is also to be found in quantum gravity. We see problems of renormalizability as well as problems of geometric scaling progression in quantum mechanics all the time; Feynman diagrams just seem to go on forever, but we can sum them all up with a couple of interesting procedures, or else avoid infinities in other ways. How much is nature governed by self-similarity? Is it just trees and cliffs which are fractal, or are the core laws also going to be fractal when we dive into them?

At least for now, we are fortunate that the patterns appear to stop with quarks and that there are only three families of subatomic particles. Yay for that. I just wanted to write this as a reminder to think fractally about problems sometimes. Nature obviously breaks the scale variance symmetry and so maybe it's nothing -- rather, something that can only occur at a high-level description. But there might be something interesting there in this discussion of how particles condense to be "the same" even when Pauli exclusion indicates that they shouldn't be "the same". I know, they don't Pauli-exclude because they have opposite momentum, but in what sense are they 'condensed' by the lattice deformation (which is real-space deformation!) if they are doomed to ultimately leave each other due to opposite momenta?

-- lighthearted observations --

The first thing that I must say is that there are many things which play together in my thought process. Time and change stop being twp sides of the same coin and start being fundamentally different gestalt.

So I guess I have a bunch of different questions. Why isn't  a black hole able to swallow its own virtual gravitons and photons etc.? Or is it able to swallow anything at all? Some things seem to be missing, force carriers among them.

A more subtle point: every point paticle with mass should be sitting at the center of a potential well of finite mass. Before black holes this was OK, but today every electron sits in the horizon of a black hole with mass at its center. 

I guess what I want to say is two things. The first is that I have a mental map which I have occasionally drawn with topics like consciousness, time, change, gravity,  measurement, cooper pairs (and particle condensation in general), and so on. 

The second is that at 1am today I wondeed whether cooper pairs weren't caused by two electrons getting within each others' event horizon and thus forming a black hole. I couldn't make this work too well with superpositions, and with entanglement, but it could explain why the parity reversal fails to operate and thus all of the wavefunctions become symmetric. (Also relativity makes clear sense of one central paradox of Cooper pairs: these two electrons with opposite momentum, for some strange reason, stay "near each other". In general relativity this is generally considered unobjectionable; even if they are flying apart at the speed of light, they cannot escape the warped geometry which they havve induced.)

-- recording --

A central problem in the denial of consciousness (as mere computation) comes when we distinguish computations from consciousness in the following way: let us watch a computation in a Chinese room unfold. You say "Do you understand Chinese?" and there is some symbol-shuffling and then a response comes out, "of course I understand Chinese." We record all of these actions on successive frames of movie film.

Now, Perose points out in Shadows of the Mind, we're in a bit of a sticky point. When we 'replay' the film, isn't this the exact same computation being done a second time? Does it again evoke the same conscious experiences? Notice that we seem to respond very emotionally to film in general, we treat (via suspension of disbelief) the images on the screen as real people whom we empathize with; we may even feel scared at the possibility that the images can "jump out at us" (hiding behind the couch from the Daleks or the fears embodied in /The Ring/).

But, when push comes to shove, we would clearly state that the images on the screen are *not* conscious. Perhaps someone *was* conscious at the time when the film was created, but this consciousness is merely "simulated" and not "reenacted" now.

The problem is that logical structures don't make this distinction. A computation which is played through a second time is, indeed, reenacted. And due to the media-independence inherent to the definition of computation, the black and white blobs moving around on screeen must also constitute a computation of the answer. But there's just something not right here. The computation frozen-in-film becomes noninteractive, static, predetermined. The printing of a copy of the film doesn't seem to evoke consciousness. Nor does the playing of it, nor does its brute existence. Maybe, you argue, there was consciousness at the moment it was recorded, but the recording itself does not suffice to reenact consciousness.


-- Cloning --
If you were to undergo some sort of horrible accident in the distant future, we might have this idea: "Oh, we will create a backup copy of you, so that you can live on in a new body without all of this injured tissue."

But imagine that this works the way that it says on the box: we create a duplicate you, doesn't matter how, which appears to talk, think, perceive, and work like you. Imagine the horror of meeting your clone face to face, with the realization that the doctors are now going to kill you, and *this other person* is going to resume the affairs of your everyday life. You might indeed *agree* with this person on many issues, and he or she might know all of your *secrets*, but there's still the paradox that despite a physical identity, they aren't you.

Quantum mechanics says that there is no general transformation which maps 

    |0, Ψ> → |Ψ, Ψ>

We might be able to construct one particular |Ψ, Ψ>, especially if we take the original process that took |0> → |Ψ> and repeat it, but we cannot duplicate an arbitrary unknown quantum state. The problem deals with linearity: all quantum mechanical operations are expected to be linear in superpositions, but the above is not. If Ψ = a + b, then we could say:
    
    |0, a>  → |a, a>
    |0, b>  → |b, b>
    |0, a + b>  → |a + b, a + b> = |a, a> + |b, b> + |a, b> + |b, a>.

Thus the transform of |0, a + b> is not the transform of |0, a> + |0, b>.

If we wanted to generate |Ψ, Ψ> in general, without knowing what |Ψ> is, what we would have to do is to repeat the experimental setup which gave us |0> → |Ψ> in the first place. If we do not do this, then the best that quantum mechanics will allow us to do is something like:
    
    |0, Ψ> → |Ψ, 0>. 
    
There is something irresistably human about the no-cloning theorem: it says that if I just treat you as a black-box quantum state, I cannot copy your consciousness without sending someone through the same path of life-experiences as you. I may be able to transfer it, but I could not have this moment of "seeing yourself and wondering who is more properly you." I might be able to find a "shortcut" to this process, but only if I could reliably measure your quantum state so that I knew what superposition I was trying to create. But measurement tends to be destructive in quantum mechanics and probably wouldn't work well unless I had a couple thousand copies of you to compare.

-- limitations on measurement--

I was interested once by a Doctor Who episode called "Blink" where the scary 
monsters are the "Weeping Angels". The Doctor says that they are "quantum 
locked": the moment that you observe them, they turn to stone, until you cease
observing them. That sounded very wrong to me. It means that they exist in a 
state where some observable -- the predicate of being stone -- is 0, and this
presumably exists as a superposition of different position-states. But in each
of those position-states, the predicate of being stone is 1. How can that be?

The quick answer is, it can't. But let me follow this question logically.

Now, it might have sounded wrong purely because it's wrong in classical theory.
We can do this via its embedding in quantum theory as incoherence: In an 
incoherent system, any predicate true of the basis states is also true 
of the system as a whole. This is because you get a diagonal density matrix:

    ρ = Σᵢ Pᵢ |i><i|

And if <i| Â |i> = C for all n, then < Â > = Tr {ρ Â} = Σᵢ Pᵢ <i|Â|i> = C. 
Thus I can state the following theorem:

>    Any numerical observable which is C for all of a set of states is also C 
>    for their incoherent superposition.

But, it turns out, quantum mechanics bends this a little bit with coherences. A
good example is the σₓ Pauli matrix, σₓ = |0><1| + |1><0| . In the 
computational basis {|0>, |1>}, you have <0| σₓ |0> = <1| σₓ |1> = 0. But in a 
state like |+> = √½ |0> + √½ |1> you can magically see <+| σₓ |+> = 1.

Clarity, and the statement of the theorem, comes if we understand that there is
also a state |−> = √½ |0> − √½ |1>, which has <−| σₓ |−> = -1. Thus in order to
sustain this "quantum lock" we need a negative number. But a proper predicate
can be treated as true-or-false, one-or-zero. There is no -1 available. So let
me state the theorem this way:

>    A predicate is an observable which can only take on values 0 or 1. Any 
>    predicate which is C for all of a set of states is also C for their 
>    coherent superposition.

This requires a simple lemma:

    If Â is a predicate, then <φ|Â|φ> = 0 → Â |φ> = 0.

Proof: project `|φ>` into the eigenbasis of `Â` to get `|φ> = a |α> + b |β>`, 
with `Â |α> = 0` and `Â |β> = |β>`. Thus `<φ|Â|φ> = |b|²` and `b = 0` under the
above assumption. Then `Â |φ> = a Â |α> + 0 Â |β> = 0 + 0 = 0`.

From there it is simple. First: `Â` is a predicate → `1 − Â` is a predicate.
So without loss of generality we can therefore let `C = 0`. Now call the basis 
states |φᵢ> and we have that `<φᵢ|Â|φᵢ> = C = 0`, thus `Â|φᵢ> = 0`. Any 
coherent superposition is a sum of eigenvectors with the same eigenvalue, and
is therefore by linearity also an eigenvector with that same eigenvalue. 

This lemma could probably be stated more generally as:

    If Â is an observable with eigenvalues on the interval [α, β] then 
    <φ|Â|φ> = α → Â |φ> = α |φ> and <φ|Â|φ> = β → Â |φ> = β |φ>.

-- The basis problem --
Here is another subtle problem which has been raised within the many-worlds interpretation but applies everywhere. You have TV in living room |L>, L = |L><L|. You have TV in bedroom |B>, B = |B><B|. (Substitute live or dead cats as you wish for Schrodinger's cat paradoxes.) Presumably these are orthogonal: <L|B> = 0. 

The problem is, *why favor the L, B basis?!* There is an equivalent basis which is:

    |P> = √½ |L> + |B>, |M> = √½ |L> − √½ |B>

Why should we observe L and not P? Why does nature prefer L to P?

    In the density matrix formalism, we don't necessarily get |L> but 
    rather L. Superpositions will, after decoherence, look like:

    ρ = ½ L + ½ B = ½ P + ½ M.

    At the very least, this looks very suggestive, as it would mean that
    Nature doesn't prefer either basis but gives us 50/50 on all of them.
    But you still have the collapse problem: I do not see P, I see L, all 
    of the time. Why should I see L and not P?

Observations 2011-01-29:
Time is distinct and might have the capacity to collapse wavefunctions.

Since every moment is a definite timestep, perhaps every motion is an "observation." Perhaps things collapse on their own, constantly, as long as there is an energy gap to do it.

Since time connects to energy, perhaps everything automatically finds itself in the energy eigenbasis, thus solving the question of "why is |0>, |1> and not |+>, |-> the eigenbasis?" The basis is whatever your energy eigenbasis is. When you want quantum effects, you make it so that you aren't doing this fundamental energy-gap thing, usually by keeping your Hamiltonian generation away from the system.

In other words, the uniqueness of basis and the uniqueness of time strike me as parallels of each other.

Penrose's idea:
    All mass carries a clock along with it by virtue of having a rest mass E = m c², E = h f. Massive things can experience time not just because they're not going at the speed of light, but because they actually carry these "intrinsic" clocks with them. 
    
An idea regarding local conservation laws:

QM pretty blatantly breaks locality in wavefunction collapse. I would like to tie this to the fact that QM breaks conservation laws in general, in these evanescent wavefunctions (tunnelling processes) that extend through potential barriers. 

The idea is very simple. Einstein's argument for the relativity of simultaneity was applied to conservation laws, arguing that they must be local, by Feynman in his Cornell lectures, in the following way.

Imagine two trains with observers at the center which happen to line up just as some event happens at both sides:
    
    ====A====
    x       x
    ====B====

Imagine that this is a nonlocal charge conservation process for observer A: A sees an electron disappear at the front of the train, and a positron disappears at the back of the train; both of these release gamma rays which A detects at the center.

If observer B moves forward relative to A, then B sees the oncoming light first and the light behind comes second. B therefore comes up with this idea that conservation was broken: while energy was conserved, for a brief instant there was one extra positron in the universe while its electron was missing.

Here's the trick: Quantum mechanics allows a violation of energy conservation for a highly limited time, or a violation of momentum conservation over a very thin length, so long as it all 'eventually' comes back into equilibrium. So QM behaves in the same way that relativity behaves when you have a nonlocal conservation principle, and QM is itself not amenable to a local theory anyways. Is there some detailed connection to be drawn here?

Another interesting peculiarity from the same Feynman lecture: angular momentum is conserved, and comes in lumps, but you would expect that it can't possibly come in lumps because you can always look at any definite-angular-momentum state from a slightly different angle. I include it here because angular momentum is a particular *changing state* -- a state where change is manifest -- and yet it's also a state where quantum weirdness is most manifest.

# Will and Time

John Searle in his Authors@Google talk identifies free will as a "tough nut to crack" -- maybe the toughest such nut in consciousness. It's a very simple principle: that free will is an illusion and doesn't do anything. (He doesn't take seriously the idea that we are not conscious in this talk, as far as I can tell. He probably shouldn't.) He says that there is only one big problem with free will being an illusion, although he identifies one small problem too.

The small problem is that, so he says, it's unlike evolution to give us something so resource-intensive as free will, if it doesn't really do anything. That is, we seem to spend a lot of time sustaining consciousness and will, seeking out food so that we can angst about other decisions. A system where consciousness is epiphenomenal and will is illusory is, in essence, a system of near-dualism, where consciousness is perhaps effected by the brain but cannot affect it. It would be strange for nature to give us all of this conscious stuff if we didn't have a "gap" in which our consciousness could act causally.

This ties into time and change because under the changeless picture afforded by time, evolution is in some basic sense wrong. Nothing is really evolving in a changeless picture because, well, nothing is changing. Consciousness and will, too, become impossible on the changeless picture.

It helps to see the world as physicists see it. Step outside of yourself into 4d spacetime, where the human body appears as a rope composed of over 10^27 particles all very parallel knotting into a body. The exact size of their knotting is a little interesting too: you are about 2m tall, 1 m across, 0.5 m wide, and about 100 ms in duration -- that is about your reaction time, and it is approximately the boundary between things perceived as distinct and things perceived as continuous. In relativity this becomes 30,000 km. So you're 2 in one way, 1 in another, 0.5 in the third direction, and 30,000,000 in the "weird direction". What I'm really saying is that to about 1 ppm, your worldlines are parallel and do not knot.

In this sense, as we see the world 4-dimensionally, we end up seeing the whole past and future as dictated by classical physics, and the fact that we call any given configuration "now" has to be described at two levels: there is the level where the worldlines themselves somehow encode the pattern "hey, it's now" -- and in that sense every moment on the worldline is "conscious" in some degenerate sense, but none of them are actually progressing forward in time; they are all bound to their present existence, changeless. It's like the old audio cassettes; the music exists purely on the magnetic track, changeless, waiting to be played. Then on the upper level, though, we might want to really describe ourselves as changing, so we might explicitly attach a dualistic soul to *actually feel* these images as it flies forth along the rope -- just like the magnetic reader which the walkman attaches to actually convert the latent music into sound. 

Evolution is relatively obvious if change is really happening, but on this account where change doesn't happen except as we attach real consciousness to latent consciousness, it's not clear why evolution would ever happen. Evolution cannot happen at any moment in time because the world is as it is, unchanging. But evolution is also not observer-dependent, so it doesn't reside in attaching the mind to the body. It's pivotal because the little problem is now seen as a big one. When you don't believe in free will, you don't believe that anything is really changing -- I mean, maybe we are experiencing change, but we're experiencing change atop a changeless universe. Without change and inheritance and the death of inadequacy, you do not see a change towards populations of greater inherited adequacy. The problem of change existing in time is seen as one and the same with the problem of will existing in matter.

Something identical happens with Searle's other argument, his big argument. He says, if you think about this stance, unfortunately, you cannot "shake the illusion", you cannot get rid of it, you are stuck with it. If you are on an airline and the hostess comes to you and says "would you like the chicken or the pasta" it does you no good to say "look, my answer was written in the book of history, so I'm just gonna sit back and see what I order." That refusal to act is only intelligible to you as an exercise of free rational action to persist in indifference rather than choose one or the other.

Tim Maudlin says in Through the Wormhole 2x03 that he's noticed the same thing in time. As much as we might say "time is an illusion", it is an illusion which we can't shake off. Our refusal to accept that we are growing old, changing, thinking -- this is only intelligible as a change, as a thought, as growth.

In other words, if you want to say that past and future "do not exist" and everything is only the present moment, so that all that's left is a durationless film of oil between, you seem to be stuck. Because let's suppose you've asked me a question. Now you face the radical problem that the asking and the question are in the past -- in what sense are they "illusory"? It's not just Searle saying "you can't be rational unless you assume that you really have free will," but we've also got that "you can't be rational unless you assume that your memories really map to some present state-of-affairs." This is all the more crucial because if we're honest with ourselves: we live in the past! It's not just that there is an intrinsic delay due to the speed of light and speed of sound in our senses, but also that there is preprocessing before you become consciously aware of something, as proven e.g. in the cutaneous rabbit illusion. What you are perceiving now is the universe as it once was, not as it now is.

There is an aspect of the Berkeleyan critique here. Bishop Berkeley dismissed dualism, you'll recall, by saying "what sense is it to say that an image resembles its object, when the object strictly speaking is totally invisible?". You see the same argument in Milič Čapek's "elusive nature of the past": how can our present-memories resemble the past when the past is totally illusory?

# Dan Dennett and "Kinds of Minds"

In his book /Kinds of Minds/, Dennett tries to talk about different ways which we might use to describe a system, and insists that the 'intentional description' -- where we imagine that an unconscious thing has preferences and acts as an agent to fulfill those preferences -- is a valid way to describe things which are too complicated for a 'design description' or a 'physical description.' His example of a design description is an alarm clock. I might have never seen this particular alarm clock go off, but on the assumption that it does in fact stand in the 'alarm clock' design pattern, I can guess that if I press a couple buttons and go to bed, its internal physical structure will compel it to wake me up with some sort of noise. I don't in advance know what the noise will be or how it is internally structured, and I really don't have to. The fact that it is designed this way is sufficient.

Dennett is much less clear about what 'physical descriptions' are, giving fewer examples. Crucial to his points about consciousness is the fact that an intentional description can be wholly valid whether or not the described thing has any modicum of consciousness.

As a way to justify a certain use of language about the rest of the world, I think this isn't a bad effort -- i.e. that a solipsist might be able to use this sort of dialogue to discuss what other people 'feel' or 'think' even if he or she does not believe that they are conscious. But of course, Dennett is much more concerned with giving an evolution's-eye-view of a potential emergence of things that look like conscious organization, not in the physical/ontological characterization of the actual facts of conscious experience -- the engineering question of "how could I go about reading your mind?"

What I want to bring up is this: the intentional approach is actually, I think, much broader than Dennett gives it credit for. I would go so far as to say that our physical laws are based on an intentional description. A universe wanders about its phase space following gradients in its Hamiltonian; if there is dissipation then it wants to minimize its energy; if we are uncertain about where exactly it is then it sees this and multiplies our uncertainty with its interaction terms; and so forth. Physical objects "follow the laws of physics". If there is a difference, it is only that the principle of inertia says that particles don't want to follow their preferences (the forces on them) straight away, but instead modify their current trajectory in that general direction. This can lead to cases like orbit, where the Earth's preference is to go toward the Sun, but it is stuck in a stable elliptical orbit instead because it is "lazy" and prefers to keep going in the same direction and speed that it started going in.

If that's right, then there are in fact *two* ways we conceptualize change, not just one. We conceptualize change in terms of *time*, yes, but we also conceptualize it in terms of *agency*. I don't think that these are opposed to each other, but it might provide a bit of a hint, since agency is so fundamental to how we think of ethical situations anyway. We can account for change by inventing a timeline and saying "A was this way, now it is this way" but we also have this more in-the-moment sense of "A is following a set of preferences."
