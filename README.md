This is just a disorganized collection of writings I have not yet completed and published. My publication system,
drostie.org, has been down for quite some time, and I have wanted to make sure that the rest of this content isn't 
lost if my laptop dies -- which it has been slowly showing signs of doing for several months now.

It should also help to have just one central point for all of these unfinished tangents.

These essays, in their present form, are unfinished, and I have not decided whether I am willing to release them 
to the public per my usual public-domain licensing. Probably, I will, soon.

The .xoj files are Xournal files generated when I was scribbling around with my tablet pen. There exist some 
experimental Windows binaries for Xournal, visible at [its website][http://xournal.sourceforge.net/].
