This is just a disorganized collection of writings I have not yet completed and published. My publication system,
drostie.org, has been down for quite some time, and I have wanted to make sure that the rest of this content isn't 
lost if my laptop dies -- which it has been slowly showing signs of doing for several months now.

It should also help to have just one central point for all of these unfinished tangents.
